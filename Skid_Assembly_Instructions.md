## Safety Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS**

- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**
  - Safety glasses required at all times
  - Steel-toed safety boots
  - Work gloves when handling parts
  - Back support belt recommended for heavy lifting

- **Lifting Safety:**
  - Use proper lifting techniques (bend knees, keep back straight)
  - Team lift for loads over 50 lbs
  - Request assistance when needed

- **Work Area Safety:**
  - Keep work area clean and free of debris
  - Ensure adequate lighting
  - Maintain clear walkways
  - Report any damaged equipment immediately

- **Banding Safety:**
  - Always tension banding away from body
  - Wear safety glasses during banding operations
  - Keep fingers clear of banding tool mechanisms

## Ergonomic Considerations

### Operator Guidelines
- **Work Height:** Maintain work surface at waist level when possible
- **Posture:** Keep back straight, avoid twisting while lifting
- **Reach:** Keep parts within comfortable reach zone
- **Rotation:** Rotate tasks among team members to prevent repetitive strain
- **Breaks:** Take regular breaks every 2 hours for stretching
- **Team Work:** Use team lifting for heavy or awkward loads

### Workstation Setup

## Assembly Steps

### Step 1: Base Preparation
![Step 1](Step%201.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. Position the 40"×48" wooden skid base on a stable, level surface
2. Place the 40"×48" bottom cardboard sheet on the skid base
3. Ensure cardboard sheet is centered and aligned with skid edges
4. Verify the base is clean and free from debris

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Skid base is level and stable
- [ ] Bottom cardboard sheet covers entire base
- [ ] No debris or damage visible

---

### Step 2: First Layer Placement
![Step 2](Step%202.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. Carefully place the first 4 parts on the bottom cardboard sheet
2. Arrange parts according to specified layout pattern
3. Ensure parts are properly aligned and positioned
4. Check for proper spacing between parts

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] All 4 parts are correctly positioned
- [ ] Parts are aligned with layout specifications
- [ ] Proper spacing maintained between parts

---

### Step 3: First Separator Installation
![Step 3](Step%203.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. Place the first 40"×40" separator cardboard sheet over the first layer
2. Center the separator sheet to provide equal coverage
3. Smooth out any wrinkles or air bubbles
4. Ensure separator sheet lies flat

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Separator sheet is centered and flat
- [ ] No wrinkles or air bubbles present
- [ ] Sheet covers all parts adequately

---

### Step 4: Layer Building Process
![Step 4](Step%204.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. Continue adding layers following the same pattern:
   - Place 4 parts per layer
   - Add separator sheet after each layer
2. Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
3. Build layers systematically to ensure stability
4. Check alignment after every 5 layers

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Layers are building evenly
- [ ] Parts remain properly aligned
- [ ] Stack remains stable during building

---

### Step 5: Mid-Assembly Inspection
![Step 5](Step%205.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. At the 10-layer mark, perform mid-assembly inspection
2. Check overall stack alignment and stability
3. Verify separator sheets are properly positioned
4. Make any necessary adjustments before continuing

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Stack is straight and properly aligned
- [ ] No parts are protruding or misaligned
- [ ] Separator sheets are correctly positioned
- [ ] Stack remains stable

---

### Step 6: Continued Layer Assembly
![Step 6](Step%206.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. Continue building layers 11-20
2. Maintain consistent placement pattern
3. Add separator sheets between each layer
4. Monitor stack stability throughout process

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Layers 11-20 properly assembled
- [ ] Stack maintains structural integrity
- [ ] All separator sheets in place

---

### Step 7: Final Layer and Top Sheet
![Step 7](Step%207.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. Place the final (20th) layer of 4 parts
2. Ensure final layer is properly aligned with stack
3. Place the 40"×48" top cardboard sheet over the entire assembly
4. Verify top sheet covers the complete load

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Final layer properly positioned
- [ ] Top cardboard sheet covers entire load
- [ ] Stack is complete with all 80 parts
- [ ] Overall assembly is stable and aligned

---

### Step 8: Pre-Banding Preparation
![Step 8](Step%208.jpg)

**Procedure:**
1. Perform final inspection of completed stack
2. Ensure all edges are aligned
3. Check that top sheet is properly positioned
4. Verify stack is ready for banding operations

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Stack is properly aligned on all sides
- [ ] Top sheet is secure and properly positioned
- [ ] Assembly is stable and ready for banding
- [ ] Work area is clear for banding operations

## Banding Operations

### Banding Sequence for Optimal Performance

**CRITICAL:** Follow this exact sequence for optimal bander performance:

1. **Over Load First**
   - Position first band over the top of the load
   - Route band straight down both sides
   - Ensure band is centered on the load

2. **Under Skid**
   - Thread band under the wooden skid base
   - Maintain proper tension during threading
   - Keep band straight and avoid twisting

3. **Back to Top for Tensioning**
   - Bring band back to top of load
   - Position banding tool for optimal access
   - Apply tension according to specifications

### Operator Tips for Banding

**Threading Technique:**
- Keep banding material straight and untangled
- Use smooth, controlled movements
- Avoid sharp bends that could weaken the band

**Tensioning Guidelines:**
- Apply tension gradually and evenly
- Listen for proper tensioning sound from equipment
- Stop immediately if unusual sounds occur
- Check band tension with tension gauge if available

**Tool Maintenance:**
- Keep banding tool clean and lubricated
- Check cutting mechanism before each use
- Report any tool malfunctions immediately
- Store tools properly after use

**Efficiency Tips:**
- Pre-position banding material for easy access
- Work systematically around the load
- Use proper body mechanics during banding
- Complete one band fully before starting the next
