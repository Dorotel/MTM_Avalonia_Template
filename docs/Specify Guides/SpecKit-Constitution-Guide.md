# Guide: /constitution — Project Principles

What it does
- Creates clear “house rules” for your project (quality, testing, UX, performance). Your agent reads these rules before making plans or code.

When to use it
- First thing after init. It guides every choice later.

How to run
```text
/constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

What to include
- Code quality: linting, reviews, “no broken main”
- Testing: unit, integration, coverage target
- UX: accessibility, keyboard support, large tap targets
- Performance: page load budget, API timeouts

What you get
- .specify/memory/constitution.md updated with your rules

Tips
- Keep it short (1–2 pages). Clear beats clever.
- Update it when you learn better ways.
```
