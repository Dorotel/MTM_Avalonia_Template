# Guide: /tasks — Break Work into Steps

What it does
- Turns your plan into a checklist of small, buildable tasks.

When to use it
- After /plan is finished.

How to run
```text
/tasks
```

What a good task looks like
- One clear action
- A small, testable outcome
- Links to the spec or plan
- Estimated effort (optional)

What you get
- A tasks.md file with an ordered list, dependencies, and parallel items where safe

Tips
- Smaller tasks = faster wins and easier reviews.
- Make testing part of each task (“include unit tests”).
