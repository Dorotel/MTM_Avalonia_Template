# Guide: /clarify — Fill the Gaps

What it does
- Finds unclear parts of your spec and asks targeted questions so you don’t guess later.

When to use it
- Right after /specify and before /plan.

How to run
```text
/clarify
```

What happens
- The agent asks you short, specific questions.
- Your answers are recorded in the spec (Clarifications section).

Why it matters
- Saves time. Fewer surprises during planning and coding.

Tips
- Don’t skip. Even a few answers make planning much easier.
- If you must skip (spike/prototype), say so in your message.
