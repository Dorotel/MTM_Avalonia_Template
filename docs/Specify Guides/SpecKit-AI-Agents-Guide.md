# Supported AI Agents — What You Can Use

Works with
- Claude Code
- GitHub Copilot
- Gemini CLI
- Cursor
- Qwen Code
- opencode
- Windsurf
- Kilo Code
- Auggie CLI
- Roo Code
- Codex CLI (limited support for custom args)

How to pick one
- Choose the agent you already use or the one your team supports.
- You can switch later by re‑running “specify init” with a different “--ai” option.

Tip
- If an agent acts odd, open an issue in the Spec Kit repo and include what you tried.
