# End‑to‑End Flow (All the Steps Together)

1) /constitution — set the rules
2) /specify — write the feature spec
3) /clarify — answer missing questions
4) /plan — choose tech and design
5) /tasks — make a checklist
6) /analyze — cross‑check coverage
7) /implement — build and test

Simple example
```text
/constitution Keep it simple, test everything important, and aim for fast pages.
/specify Build a small photo album app where I can drag albums around the home page.
/clarify
/plan Use vanilla JS + Vite. Store metadata locally. No uploads.
/tasks
/analyze
/implement
```

What “done” looks like
- Your feature meets the acceptance criteria in the spec
- Tests pass
- You can demo the feature from start to finish
