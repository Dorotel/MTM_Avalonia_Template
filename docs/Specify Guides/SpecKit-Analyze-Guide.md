# Guide: /analyze — Cross‑Check Before Building

What it does
- Checks if your spec, plan, and tasks agree. Finds gaps or contradictions before you write code.

When to use it
- After /tasks and before /implement.

How to run
```text
/analyze
```

What it checks
- Do tasks cover all acceptance criteria?
- Are there missing tests?
- Are there conflicts between plan and spec?

What you get
- A list of fixes to make your plan solid.

Tip
- Fix findings now; it’s cheaper than changing code later.
