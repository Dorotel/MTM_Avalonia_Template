# Guide: /plan — Pick the Tech and the Design

What it does
- Creates a technical plan that matches your spec and principles.

When to use it
- After /clarify, once the spec is clear.

How to run (example prompt)
```text
/plan Use Vite with minimal libraries. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Store metadata in local SQLite. No uploads.
```

What the plan should cover
- Tech stack (frameworks, versions)
- Architecture (layers, APIs, data model)
- Risks and trade‑offs
- What NOT to include (keeps scope small)

What you get
- Plan docs (e.g., plan.md, data-model.md, contracts)
- A clear path to break into tasks
