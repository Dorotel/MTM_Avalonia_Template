# Infor VISUAL ERP Integration via Official API Toolkit

## Feature Description for `/speckit.specify`

Migrate the application's integration with Infor VISUAL manufacturing system from custom HTTP endpoints to the official Infor VISUAL API Toolkit to improve reliability, maintainability, and ensure long-term compatibility.

## Business Value

**WHY This Matters:**
- **Reliability**: Custom HTTP endpoints are fragile and prone to breaking with VISUAL system updates
- **Maintainability**: Official toolkit is supported by Infor with documentation and updates
- **Future-Proofing**: Upcoming VISUAL upgrades may deprecate custom HTTP access methods
- **Data Integrity**: Toolkit ensures proper transaction handling and business rule enforcement
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Eliminates custom integration code that requires ongoing maintenance

## What Users Need

### Manufacturing Floor Operators
- Look up part information (specifications, inventory levels, locations)
- View real-time inventory quantities across multiple warehouse locations
- Check work order status and production schedules
- Confirm shipments and update tracking information
- Access customer and vendor contact information

### Production Supervisors
- Create and update work orders
- Track work-in-progress across production lines
- Issue materials to work orders
- Record production completions
- Generate production reports

### Inventory Managers
- Perform inventory adjustments and cycle counts
- Transfer inventory between locations
- View inventory transaction history
- Manage stock levels and reorder points
- Track inventory costs and valuations

### Quality Assurance
- Record inspection results
- Track non-conformance issues
- Document corrective actions
- Access quality control procedures

## User Experience Requirements

### Performance Expectations
- Part lookups complete in under 3 seconds
- Work order queries return results within 2 seconds
- Inventory updates reflect immediately (within 5 seconds)
- System remains responsive during multi-step operations

### Offline Capability
- Application continues operating with cached VISUAL data when network is unavailable
- Display clear indicators when working with stale/offline data
- Queue write operations for synchronization when connection restored

### Error Handling
- Clear, actionable error messages when VISUAL system is unavailable
- Graceful degradation to read-only mode if write operations fail
- Automatic retry for transient connection failures
- Guide users to alternative workflows when VISUAL operations are blocked

### Platform Scope
- **Windows Desktop**: Full VISUAL integration with read/write capabilities
- **Android/Other Platforms**: Read-only access with cached data (direct VISUAL access not available)

## Business Constraints

### Compatibility
- Must work with existing VISUAL database structure (no schema changes)
- Maintain backward compatibility with current cached data format
- Support VISUAL version 8.0+ deployed at customer sites

### Security
- Use existing OS-native credential storage (no new authentication mechanisms)
- Maintain current user permission model
- Never expose VISUAL credentials in logs or error messages
- Audit all VISUAL data access operations

### Deployment
- Zero-downtime migration (users continue working during rollout)
- Fallback to previous integration method if issues arise
- No changes to user interface or workflows
- Deploy incrementally across sites (pilot â†’ full rollout)

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- **SC-001**: Part lookup operations complete in under 3 seconds (95th percentile)
- **SC-002**: Zero data integrity issues reported in first 30 days post-migration
- **SC-003**: System availability matches or exceeds current 99.5% uptime
- **SC-004**: User-reported errors related to VISUAL integration decrease by 50%
- **SC-005**: Support tickets for VISUAL connectivity issues reduced by 60%
- **SC-006**: Successful migration with zero user retraining required

### Qualitative Outcomes
- Users experience no disruption during migration
- Operations staff report improved system stability
- Development team can deploy VISUAL updates without custom code changes
- Integration passes all existing acceptance tests with no regression

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Replace all custom HTTP-based VISUAL integrations
- Maintain exact same user-facing functionality
- Support all current VISUAL operations (read and write)
- Windows desktop application only

### Out of Scope
- Changes to VISUAL database schema or business rules
- New VISUAL features or capabilities not currently used
- Android/mobile direct VISUAL access (remains cached data only)
- Integration with other ERP systems beyond VISUAL
- Migration of historical data formats

## Key Entities

### Part Information
- Part number, description, specifications
- Inventory quantities by location
- Unit costs and pricing
- Make/buy status

### Work Orders
- Work order number, status, priority
- Scheduled dates and quantities
- Bill of materials
- Production routing

### Inventory Transactions
- Transaction type (receipt, issue, adjustment, transfer)
- Quantities and locations
- Timestamps and user attribution
- Cost and valuation data

### Shipments
- Shipment numbers and tracking information
- Shipped quantities and dates
- Customer and carrier details
- Packing information

## Assumptions

1. **VISUAL Toolkit Availability**: Infor VISUAL API Toolkit is licensed and available for use
2. **Database Access**: Application has necessary database permissions for toolkit operations
3. **Network Reliability**: Standard manufacturing network connectivity (some intermittent outages expected)
4. **User Permissions**: Current VISUAL user permissions model remains unchanged
5. **Data Volume**: VISUAL database size and query complexity remain within current operational ranges
6. **Windows Platform**: Windows desktop deployment continues as primary platform

## Dependencies

### External Systems
- Infor VISUAL manufacturing system (version 8.0+)
- VISUAL database server (must be accessible from application host)
- OS-native credential storage (Windows Credential Manager, Android KeyStore)

### Internal Components
- Existing configuration service (for connection settings)
- Secrets service (for credential management)
- Cache service (for offline data storage)
- Logging/diagnostics infrastructure

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **API Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn official toolkit patterns and best practices
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Toolkit may not support all custom queries currently in use
- **Performance Variation**: Toolkit performance characteristics may differ from HTTP approach

### Mitigation Strategies
- Conduct proof-of-concept testing with critical workflows before full migration
- Maintain HTTP fallback capability during initial rollout period
- Implement comprehensive logging to diagnose toolkit-specific issues
- Schedule migration during low-activity periods to minimize user impact

## Usage Instructions

To create the feature specification, run:

```bash
/speckit.specify Migrate Infor VISUAL ERP integration from custom HTTP endpoints to official Infor VISUAL API Toolkit. Users need reliable access to part information, work orders, inventory transactions, and shipment data. Must maintain current performance (<3s queries) and support offline operation with cached data. Windows desktop only - toolkit not available on other platforms. Zero user retraining required.
```

Or use the longer form from this document to provide more context about business value, user needs, and constraints.

## What Happens Next

1. **Specification Phase** (`/speckit.specify`): Creates detailed user stories and functional requirements
2. **Clarification Phase** (`/speckit.clarify`): Resolves any ambiguities identified in spec
3. **Planning Phase** (`/speckit.plan`): Determines HOW to implement (toolkit assemblies, architecture, etc.)
4. **Tasks Phase** (`/speckit.tasks`): Breaks down into concrete implementation tasks

The technical details in the original `InforVisualToolkitRefactorPrompt.md` become valuable during the **Planning Phase**, where toolkit DLLs, session management patterns, and interop boundaries are determined.
