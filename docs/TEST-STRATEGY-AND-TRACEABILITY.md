# Test Strategy and Traceability Plan
Ensures acceptance criteria map to tests and code, enabling audits and confidence.

For humans
- Purpose: Know what’s covered and what’s missing; speed up reviews.
- When used: Feature planning, PR reviews, releases.
- Dependencies: Specs with AC IDs, test cases, traceability tool/process.
- What depends on it: CI pipeline, QA, audits.
- Priority: High.

For AI agents
- Intent: Define unit/integration/UI test layers, AC-to-test mapping, and a traceability matrix linking AC IDs to test IDs and PRs. Include checks that Visual Toolkit citations and CSV line references exist where required.
- Dependencies: Acceptance criteria documents, test frameworks, trace builder.
- Consumers: CI, dashboards, compliance reports.
- Non-functionals: Low maintenance cost; auto-generation where possible.
- Priority: High.

Layers
- Unit: Domain rules, validators, mappers.
- Integration: Repositories (app DB), API endpoints, Visual projection fallbacks (mocked/staged).
- UI/Flow: Scan/submit flows with fake services.

Traceability
- AC ID format per feature (e.g., AC-RECV-###).
- Each PR lists implemented AC IDs; CI ensures tests exist or are planned with tickets.
- CI gate: fail or warn when Visual references lack Toolkit citations or CSV line placeholders.

Clarification questions
- Q: Should we fail PR checks if AC IDs are missing?
  - Why: Enforces discipline.
  - Suggested: Yes.
  - Reason: Keeps spec and code aligned.
  - Options: [A] Warn [B] Fail [C] Block only on release branches
