## üéØ The Big Picture

### What Problem Does This Solve?

[Explain in 2-3 sentences what pain point or business need this addresses. Use everyday language.]

**Example**: "Right now, users have to manually copy information from one screen to another, which takes 5 minutes per order and leads to mistakes. This feature will let them click a button to automatically transfer the information, saving time and reducing errors."

### Who Benefits?

[List the types of people who will use this feature and how it helps them]

**Example**:
- **Warehouse Workers**: Can process orders faster without typing
- **Managers**: Get more accurate reports because there are fewer data entry errors
- **Customers**: Receive their orders sooner because processing is faster

## üìñ What Users Will Experience

### The Main User Journey

[Describe step-by-step what a typical user does with this feature, like telling a story]

**Example**: "Sarah, a warehouse worker, scans a barcode on an incoming package. The system shows her the order details on screen. She reviews the information to make sure it matches the package, then taps the 'Confirm Receipt' button. The system automatically updates the inventory records and sends the customer a notification that their package has arrived."

### What Happens in Different Situations?

#### Happy Path (Everything Works)
1. User does [action]
2. System responds by [what happens]
3. User sees [result]
4. Final outcome: [end state]

#### When Things Go Wrong
[Describe what happens if something doesn't work as expected]

**Example**: "If the barcode is damaged and won't scan, the system shows a message saying 'Barcode unreadable - please type the order number manually.' The worker can then type in the number instead of scanning."
