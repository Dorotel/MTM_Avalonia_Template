## üéØ Building Strategy

### What We're Building On

[List the major technologies or systems being used, explained in simple terms]

**Example**:
- **Database System**: We'll store information using [database name] - think of it as a filing cabinet that can find information very quickly
- **User Interface**: We'll build screens using [UI framework] - this determines how things look and feel when users interact with it
- **Security System**: We'll protect user information using [security approach] - like having a secure lock on the filing cabinet

### Why These Choices?

[Explain why the team selected these approaches in business terms]

**Example**: "We're using MySQL for the database because it's reliable, our team knows it well, and it can handle the number of users we expect. This means faster development and fewer unexpected problems."

## üèóÔ∏è Major Building Blocks

This section breaks down the work into major pieces, like building a house room by room.

### Block 1: [Component Name]

**What it does**: [Simple explanation]
**Why it's needed**: [Business value]
**How long it will take**: [Rough estimate]
**Who works on this**: [Role/team]

**Example**:
- **What it does**: The "Login System" checks who you are when you start the app
- **Why it's needed**: So only authorized people can access sensitive information
- **How long it will take**: About 2 weeks
- **Who works on this**: Security developer

### Block 2: [Component Name]

[Repeat pattern for each major component]

## üìÖ Work Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal**: Set up the basic structure

**What happens**:
- Create the project files and folders
- Set up the database
- Establish security measures
- Create the basic skeleton of the application

**What you'll see**: Not much visible yet - this is like laying the foundation of a house

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-5)

**Goal**: Build the main functionality

**What happens**:
- Create screens users will interact with
- Connect screens to the database
- Implement the main workflows (like processing orders)

**What you'll see**: Working screens you can click through, but not all features work yet

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Weeks 6-7)

**Goal**: Make it reliable and user-friendly

**What happens**:
- Fix bugs and issues
- Test with real-world scenarios
- Improve user experience based on feedback
- Add helpful error messages

**What you'll see**: Fully functional feature ready for real use

## üîó How It Connects

### What It Talks To

[List systems or components this feature connects with, explained simply]

**Example**:
- **Customer Database**: Reads customer information to display their order history
- **Email System**: Sends order confirmation emails automatically
- **Barcode Scanner**: Receives scanned product codes from warehouse devices

### What Could Break

[List dependencies and potential issues in plain language]

**Example**:
"If the barcode scanner is offline, workers can still type in product codes manually - it just takes a bit longer. The system is designed to keep working even when one piece has problems."

---

## üé® User Experience Approach

### How Will It Look?

[Describe the visual and interaction approach]

**Example**: "We're keeping the design simple and clean - large buttons that are easy to tap, clear labels, and consistent colors throughout. Think of apps you use every day like [familiar app name] - that's the level of polish we're aiming for."

### How Will It Feel to Use?

[Describe the user experience philosophy]

**Example**: "Our goal is that users can accomplish tasks in 3 clicks or less. We're avoiding complicated menus and hidden features - everything should be obvious and where you'd expect it."

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Challenges

### Things That Could Slow Us Down

[List potential problems in non-technical terms]

**Example**:
- **Learning Curve**: This is the first time the team uses [new technology] - might take a week to get comfortable
- **Testing Complexity**: Need to test with many different barcode scanner models - requires borrowing equipment
- **Data Migration**: Moving old order data into the new system requires careful checking to avoid errors

### Our Backup Plans

[Explain how the team will handle problems]

**Example**: "If [new technology] turns out to be too difficult to learn quickly, we have experience with [alternative] and can switch to that instead. It would add about 3 days to the schedule."

---

## üìä Quality Measures

### How We'll Know It's Ready

[Explain testing and quality checks in everyday terms]

**Example**:
- **Speed Test**: Processes 100 orders in under 5 seconds (fast enough that users won't notice any delay)
- **Accuracy Test**: Handles 10,000 test orders without making any mistakes
- **User Test**: 5 actual warehouse workers try it and can use it without training
- **Stress Test**: Works smoothly even when 50 people use it at the same time

### What "Done" Looks Like

- ‚úÖ All planned features work as described in the overview document
- ‚úÖ Tested with real users who confirm it solves their problem
- ‚úÖ No critical bugs or issues
- ‚úÖ Fast enough that users don't get frustrated waiting
- ‚úÖ Documentation written so new users can learn it
- ‚úÖ Team trained on how to support it

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### What's Included in the Work

- Developer time to write the code
- Testing time to verify everything works
- Design time for the user interface
- Documentation writing
- Team training sessions

### What's NOT Included

[Clarify what costs are separate]

**Example**:
- Purchasing additional barcode scanners (hardware cost)
- Ongoing monthly hosting fees (operational cost)
- Training end users (training department handles this)
