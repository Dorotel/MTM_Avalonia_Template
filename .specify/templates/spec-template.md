# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications Q&A Template

Use this section whenever any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ‚Ä¶] markers exist in the spec. Keep each question atomic and traceable.

### How to use
- Create one entry per ambiguity with a unique ID: CL-001, CL-002, ‚Ä¶
- Quote the exact marker text in ‚ÄúQuestion‚Äù.
- Add a proposed interim assumption (to unblock planning) and note its risk.
- After an answer is agreed, update ‚ÄúAnswer/Decision‚Äù and list all ‚ÄúSpec Changes‚Äù.
- Remove the corresponding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ‚Ä¶] tag(s) from the body once resolved.

### Index
- Open: list CL IDs with a short label
- Resolved: list CL IDs with a short outcome

### Entry Template (copy per question)
- ID: CL-###
- Tag location(s): section and line or bullet where the marker appears
- Question (exact): the full text from the marker
- Context: why this matters for scope, users, or testing
- Options considered:
  - Option A: brief
  - Option B: brief
- Proposed interim assumption: the assumption to proceed if not answered now
- Impact if unresolved: risks to scope, timeline, testing, or dependencies
- Priority: High | Medium | Low
- Owner: decision-maker
- Due date: yyyy-mm-dd
- Status: Open | Answered | Deferred
- Answer/Decision: the agreed resolution (concise)
- Spec changes:
  - Update section ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - Add/modify requirements ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - Remove marker(s) at ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù
- Notes: any follow-ups or dependencies

### Minimal Example (illustrative)
- ID: CL-001
- Tag location(s): Requirements > FR-006
- Question (exact): authenticate users via which method?
- Context: affects user flows and acceptance tests
- Options considered: A) Email/Password B) SSO
- Proposed interim assumption: Email/Password
- Impact if unresolved: blocks acceptance scenarios
- Priority: High
- Owner: Product
- Due date: 2025-10-10
- Status: Answered
- Answer/Decision: Use Email/Password
- Spec changes:
  - Updated Requirements (FR-006) to specify Email/Password
  - Removed marker from FR-006
- Notes: Revisit SSO in a separate feature

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üìÖ Keep it concise and focused on key points
- üîÑ Include examples and use cases to illustrate concept
- ‚úçÔ∏è Use clear and simple language, avoiding jargon, but make it easy for a copilot agent to understand

---

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - **MAMP MySQL database changes** (if feature modifies database):
     - Which tables are created/modified?
     - What columns, types, and constraints?
     - Are JSON files in `.github/mamp-database/` referenced?
     - Is `migrations-history.json` updated with version increment?
   - **Visual ERP integration** (if feature accesses Visual):
     - Which Visual tables/data are accessed?
     - Are API Toolkit commands read-only?
     - Are commands in whitelist (`docs/VISUAL-WHITELIST.md`)?
     - Platform-specific access patterns (Windows direct vs Android via MTM Server API)?

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

### Database Schema Changes *(include if feature modifies MAMP MySQL database)*

**IMPORTANT**: Before documenting changes, ALWAYS reference existing schema in `.github/mamp-database/schema-tables.json`

**Tables Modified/Created**:
- **[TableName]**: [Brief description of purpose]
  - Columns added/modified: [list columns with types]
  - Indexes required: [list indexes for performance]
  - Foreign keys: [relationships to other tables]
  - Reason: [Why this change is needed]

**Schema Documentation Requirements**:
- [ ] Read `.github/mamp-database/schema-tables.json` before planning
- [ ] Document exact table names (case-sensitive: `Users`, not `users`)
- [ ] Document exact column names (case-sensitive: `UserId`, not `userid`)
- [ ] Specify data types (VARCHAR(100), INT, DATETIME, BOOLEAN, etc.)
- [ ] Document nullable vs NOT NULL constraints
- [ ] Document default values where applicable
- [ ] List indexes needed for query performance
- [ ] Update `.github/mamp-database/migrations-history.json` with version increment

**Example**:
- **UserPreferences**: Stores user-specific application settings
  - Columns: `PreferenceId` (INT, PK), `UserId` (INT, FK), `PreferenceKey` (VARCHAR(100)), `PreferenceValue` (TEXT), `LastUpdated` (DATETIME)
  - Indexes: INDEX on `UserId`, INDEX on `PreferenceKey`
  - Foreign keys: `UserId` ‚Üí `Users.UserId`
  - Reason: FR-032 requires persistent user preferences across sessions
