---

## Fixes Applied (2025-10-06)

### ✅ A1: Terminology Drift (HIGH) - FIXED
**Issue**: "Quick Actions Panel" vs "Quick Actions Commands"
**Fix Applied**: Standardized on "Quick Actions Panel" throughout spec.md and tasks.md (T030, T034, T045)

### ✅ A2: Coverage Gap - Android Platform Testing (HIGH) - FIXED
**Issue**: NFR-013 to NFR-015 lacked validation task for Android graceful degradation
**Fix Applied**: Added **T061: Integration Test - Android Platform Graceful Degradation** (35 min task)
- Validates "Not Available" displayed for connection pool stats on Android
- Ensures no crashes on missing features
- Verifies UI layout consistency

### ✅ A3: Ambiguity - CPU Metrics Update Mechanism (MEDIUM) - FIXED
**Issue**: CL-006 unresolved (timer polling vs event-driven)
**Fix Applied**: Documented CL-006 resolution in spec.md
- Answer: Timer polling with configurable interval (1-30s, default 5s)
- Rationale: Simpler implementation, adequate for Phase 1

### ✅ A4: Ambiguity - Export Formats (MEDIUM) - FIXED
**Issue**: CL-003 unresolved (JSON + Markdown?)
**Fix Applied**: Documented CL-003 resolution in spec.md
- Answer: JSON mandatory (Phase 1), Markdown optional stretch goal (Phase 2)
- Rationale: JSON provides machine-readable diagnostics (higher priority)

### ✅ A4b: Ambiguity - Android Connection Stats (MEDIUM) - FIXED
**Issue**: CL-004 unresolved (Android connection pool behavior)
**Fix Applied**: Documented CL-004 resolution in spec.md
- Answer: Desktop-first implementation, Android shows "Not Available"
- Rationale: Android uses MTM Server API (no direct MySQL pool access)

### ✅ A5: Underspecification - PII Sanitization Patterns (MEDIUM) - FIXED
**Issue**: FR-042 lacked specific regex patterns
**Fix Applied**: Added regex patterns to spec.md FR-042 and tasks.md T018, T021
- Password: `password[:\s]*[^\s]+` → `password: [REDACTED]`
- Token: `(token|key|secret)[:\s]*[^\s]+` → `$1: [REDACTED]`
- Email: `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}` → `[EMAIL_REDACTED]`

### ✅ A6: Inconsistency - Error History Count (MEDIUM) - FIXED
**Issue**: Spec said "last 10 errors", code used 100 buffer
**Fix Applied**: Updated spec.md FR-024 and tasks.md T032 to clarify
- Buffer: Max 100 errors retained in circular buffer
- Display: Last 10 shown in UI
- ErrorCount property shows total count

### ✅ A7: Duplication - No UI Blocking (LOW) - FIXED
**Issue**: "No UI blocking" in both FR-006 and NFR-003
**Fix Applied**: Removed from FR-006, kept in NFR-003 (proper location)
- FR-006 now references NFR-003 for UI blocking requirements

### ✅ A8: Documentation Acceptance Criteria Missing (LOW) - FIXED
**Issue**: T053, T054 lacked specific acceptance criteria
**Fix Applied**: Added detailed acceptance criteria to both tasks
- T053: 1 screenshot per feature, usage examples, max 3000 words
- T054: Non-technical language, numbered lists, stakeholder validation, max 2000 words

### ✅ A9: Additional Scenarios - Minimal Detail (LOW) - FIXED
**Issue**: Scenarios 2-5 listed by title only
**Fix Applied**: Expanded all scenarios with brief narratives in spec.md
- Scenario 2: Bob monitors CPU/memory during batch import
- Scenario 3: Carol exports diagnostics for bug report
- Scenario 4: Dave reviews error history for intermittent failures
- Scenario 5: Eve verifies environment variable precedence

### ✅ Bonus Fix: FR-044 "Copy to Clipboard" Coverage Gap - FIXED
**Issue**: FR-044 lacked task coverage
**Fix Applied**: Added "Copy to Clipboard" button to T030 (Quick Actions Panel Commands) and T038 (XAML)
- `[RelayCommand] CopyDiagnosticsToClipboardAsync()` - Copy JSON to clipboard

- **Phase 2 Coverage**: 100% (FR-010 to FR-013, FR-037 to FR-039)
- **Phase 3 Coverage**: 0% (Deferred - Network Diagnostics, Historical Trends, Live Log per plan.md strategy)

---

## Coverage Gaps Explanation

### Phase 3 Deferral (Expected)
The plan.md explicitly states Phase 3 tasks (Network Diagnostics, Historical Trends, Live Log) are deferred:

> **Phase 3 Tasks (3-4 weeks, ~20 tasks)**: Feature 9: Network Diagnostics (6 tasks), Feature 10: Historical Trends (6 tasks), Feature 11: Live Log Viewer (7 tasks), Feature 12: Export Functionality (9 tasks)

**Current Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 tasks only (T001-T060). This is **expected and documented**.

### Genuine Gaps
- **FR-044**: "Copy to Clipboard" option - Should be added to T030 (Quick Actions Commands) or T038 (Quick Actions Panel XAML)

---

## Constitution Alignment Issues

**Status**: ✅ **PASS** (All 9 principles verified)

### Principle I: Cross-Platform First
✅ **COMPLIANT**: NFR-013 to NFR-015 specify Windows Desktop (primary) + Android graceful degradation ("show 'Not Available'"). T040 includes Android handling.

### Principle II: MVVM Community Toolkit Standard
✅ **COMPLIANT**: All ViewModels use `[ObservableProperty]` and `[RelayCommand]` (T026-T035). No ReactiveUI patterns.

### Principle III: Test-First Development
✅ **COMPLIANT**: TDD workflow enforced - contract tests (T014-T015) → implementation (T016-T018) → unit tests (T019-T021). Coverage goal >80% stated.

### Principle IV: Theme V2 Semantic Tokens
✅ **COMPLIANT**: XAML tasks (T036-T042) specify `{DynamicResource}` usage. NFR-007 mandates ThemeV2 tokens.

### Principle V: Null Safety and Error Resilience
✅ **COMPLIANT**: Nullable reference types enforced (.NET 9.0 with nullable enabled). T048 adds comprehensive error handling.

### Principle VI: Compiled Bindings Only
✅ **COMPLIANT**: T036-T042 XAML tasks explicitly require `x:DataType` and `{CompiledBinding}` syntax.

### Principle VII: Dependency Injection via AppBuilder
✅ **COMPLIANT**: T022 registers services in DI container. Services use constructor injection.

### Principle VIII: MAMP MySQL Database Documentation
✅ **COMPLIANT**: Feature uses **in-memory only** (no database changes per plan.md). No schema-tables.json updates required.

### Principle IX: Visual ERP Integration Standards
✅ **COMPLIANT**: Feature does not access Visual ERP. No Visual API calls.

**No Constitutional Violations Found.**

**Report Generated**: 2025-10-06 (Initial Analysis)
**Report Updated**: 2025-10-06 (All Issues Fixed)
**Analysis Duration**: 15 minutes (initial) + 20 minutes (fixes)
**Next Review**: After Phase 1 completion (T001-T045)

### A1: Terminology Drift (HIGH)
**Location**: spec.md:FR-026 vs tasks.md:T030
**Issue**: spec.md uses "Quick Actions Panel", tasks.md uses "Quick Actions Commands"
**Impact**: Developer confusion about component naming
**Recommendation**: Use "Quick Actions Panel" consistently (UI component name). Rename T030 to "Add Quick Actions Panel Commands to DebugTerminalViewModel"

### A2: Coverage Gap - Android Platform Testing (HIGH)
**Location**: spec.md:NFR-013 to NFR-015 / tasks.md
**Issue**: NFR-013 to NFR-015 mandate Android graceful degradation ("Not Available"), but no dedicated task validates this
**Impact**: Android platform validation missing from task list
**Recommendation**: Add **T061: Integration Test - Android Platform Graceful Degradation**
- Verify "Not Available" displayed for connection pool stats on Android
- Verify no crashes on missing features

### A3: Ambiguity - CPU Metrics Update Mechanism (MEDIUM)
**Location**: spec.md:FR-001 / CL-006 (Open)
**Issue**: "Updated every 1 second" - implementation method unclear (timer polling vs event-driven)
**Context**: CL-006 remains unresolved (deferred to planning)
**Impact**: Implementation approach flexibility (timer chosen in T016, but not spec-mandated)
**Recommendation**: Accept timer polling as default (per T016 implementation note), document CL-006 resolution

### A4: Ambiguity - Export Formats (MEDIUM)
**Location**: spec.md:FR-040 / CL-003 (Open)
**Issue**: "JSON + Markdown" - Markdown export priority unclear
**Context**: CL-003 unresolved (deferred)
**Impact**: Low - T018 can implement JSON first, add Markdown later if time permits
**Recommendation**: Document CL-003 resolution: "JSON first, Markdown Phase 2 stretch goal"

### A5: Underspecification - PII Sanitization Patterns (MEDIUM)
**Location**: spec.md:FR-042 / tasks.md:T018, T021
**Issue**: "Sanitize sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens)" - no regex patterns specified
**Impact**: Implementation variation, incomplete sanitization risk
**Recommendation**: Add to T018 acceptance criteria:
- Redact regex patterns: `password[:\s]*[^\s]+`, `token[:\s]*[^\s]+`, `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`
- Test in T021 with sample PII data

### A6: Inconsistency - Error History Count (MEDIUM)
**Location**: spec.md:FR-024 vs tasks.md:T032
**Issue**: spec.md says "last 10 errors", T032 code comment shows circular buffer with 100 max
**Impact**: Ambiguity in memory budget and UI display count
**Recommendation**: Clarify intent - likely 100 max buffer, display last 10 in UI. Update FR-024 to "Display last 10 errors from buffer (max 100 retained)"

### A7: Duplication - No UI Blocking (LOW)
**Location**: spec.md:FR-006 and NFR-003
**Issue**: Same requirement stated twice
**Impact**: Redundancy, no functional issue
**Recommendation**: Keep in NFR-003 (performance), remove from FR-006 or rephrase as "See NFR-003"

### A8: Documentation Acceptance Criteria Missing (LOW)
**Location**: tasks.md:T053, T054
**Issue**: Documentation tasks lack specific acceptance criteria (e.g., "Include 1 screenshot per feature", "Max 2000 words")
**Impact**: Subjective completion criteria
**Recommendation**: Add to T053: "1 screenshot per feature, usage example for each Quick Action", T054: "Non-technical language validated by product stakeholder"

### A9: Additional Scenarios - Minimal Detail (LOW)
**Location**: spec.md: Scenarios 2-5
**Issue**: Listed by title only ("Developer monitors real-time CPU/memory during heavy operation")
**Impact**: Low - primary scenario has full detail
**Recommendation**: Optional expansion for clarity, but not blocking (spec.md focuses on primary scenario)
