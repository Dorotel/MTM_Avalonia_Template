## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

- Q: When credentials cannot be retrieved from OS-native storage (corrupted keychain, revoked permissions), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Prompt user for re-entry - Show credential dialog, attempt to re-save to OS storage
- Q: When checking if a feature is enabled but the feature's settings haven't been configured yet, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Keep feature turned off - Treat unconfigured features as disabled until enabled, record note in logs
- Q: When reading a configuration setting from an environment variable but the value doesn't match what's expected (e.g., "ABC" instead of a number), what should happen? ‚Üí A: Combination of use default value with log warning AND show dialog to user for correction - Application continues with safe defaults while alerting user to the configuration problem
- Q: When OS-native secure storage is completely unavailable (not just specific credentials, but entire storage system), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Prompt user for required credentials with clear explanation - Show user-friendly dialog explaining that secure storage is unavailable and request re-entry of needed credentials (e.g., "We couldn't access your saved login information. Please enter your Visual ERP username and password to continue.")
- Q: When a user changes a setting at runtime (display preferences, default filters, UI customization), where should those personal settings be saved? ‚Üí A: Combination of admin-configured central server location AND database storage - User folder locations stored in admin-configured central server location [PLACEHOLDER: Path to be determined], user preferences stored in MAMP MySQL 5.7 database [PLACEHOLDER: Schema/table structure to be determined]
- Q: Where should user preferences (like display settings, sort orders, default filters) be saved in the database? ‚Üí A: JSON configuration file with placeholders - Create a JSON configuration file defining database schema (table structures, column types, constraints, relationships) with placeholder values that developer will replace later before MySQL setup.
- Q: Should the Android version connect directly to the MySQL database or use an intermediary server? ‚Üí A: Direct MySQL connection - Android app connects directly to MAMP MySQL database (same as Windows Desktop). Application will not be public-facing, so no need for connection pool limits or intermediary API server.
- Q: Where should the list of allowed Visual API Toolkit commands be stored, and what commands should be included? ‚Üí A: Configuration file with read-only commands - Store whitelist in application configuration file (appsettings.json or similar). Include any Visual API Toolkit commands that are NOT write commands (read-only operations only).
- Q: When showing the user a configuration error notification, what should the message look like and how should it appear? ‚Üí A: Severity-dependent approach - For non-critical settings (display preferences, timeouts, filters): Show status bar indicator with warning icon that displays details on click (non-intrusive). For critical settings (user credentials, database connection, required configuration): Show modal dialog blocking user interaction until setting is corrected (forces resolution before continuing).
- Q: When feature flags are changed on the server, how should running user applications respond? ‚Üí A: Next launch only - Feature flag changes on server are applied only when user's MTM_Application_Launcher detects version mismatch and updates their local copy. This ties feature flags to version deployments for predictable, stable experience and leverages existing launcher infrastructure.

### Session 2025-10-05 (Additional Clarifications)
- Q: Where should admin-configured central server path for user folders be specified? ‚Üí A: Use JSON config file with placeholder; default to MyDocuments for now
- Q: Where should the database schema configuration file be located? ‚Üí A: root/config folder
- Q: What accessibility and localization support is required? ‚Üí A: Both accessibility and localization; localization service already implemented
- Q: What are the data volume/scale assumptions? ‚Üí A: Up to 1,000 users, moderate data volume; allow admin to remove inactive users and their data
- Q: Are there compliance or regulatory constraints? ‚Üí A: No specific compliance required; not health-related, based in USA

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**Developer Scenario**: A developer working on the MTM Avalonia Template application needs to configure the system for different environments (Development, Staging, Production). They need to securely store Visual ERP credentials, toggle feature flags to enable/disable functionality, and ensure the application behaves correctly in each environment without accidentally leaking production credentials or enabling unsafe development features in production.

**System Administrator Scenario**: A system administrator deploying the application to production needs to set environment-specific variables (database connection strings, API endpoints) without modifying code or configuration files, ensuring credentials are stored securely using OS-native mechanisms (Windows DPAPI or Android KeyStore).

**End User Scenario**: An end user launches the application, and it automatically detects the current environment, loads appropriate configuration values with proper precedence (environment variables override user settings override defaults), and enables/disables features based on rollout percentages and environment flags.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has set MTM_ENVIRONMENT="Development", **When** the application starts, **Then** it loads development-specific settings and enables all development feature flags.

2. **Given** a system administrator stores Visual ERP credentials using OS-native secrets storage, **When** the application needs to authenticate, **Then** it retrieves credentials securely without exposing them in logs or configuration files.

3. **Given** a feature flag "Visual.UseForItems" has a 50% rollout percentage in Staging environment, **When** the application evaluates this flag, **Then** approximately 50% of users see the feature enabled (deterministic per user).

4. **Given** an environment variable "MTM_API_TIMEOUT=60" is set, **When** the application reads "API:TimeoutSeconds" configuration, **Then** it returns 60 (environment variable precedence over defaults).

5. **Given** a user has changed a configuration value at runtime via ConfigurationService.SetValue(), **When** the configuration changes, **Then** all subscribers receive a notification event with old and new values.

6. **Given** the application is running on Android, **When** it needs to store credentials, **Then** it uses Android KeyStore (not Windows DPAPI).

7. **Given** the application is running on an unsupported OS (macOS, Linux), **When** it attempts to initialize SecretsService, **Then** it throws PlatformNotSupportedException.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when environment variable MTM_ENVIRONMENT is not set?**
  ‚Üí System defaults to "Development" (DEBUG builds) or "Production" (RELEASE builds) based on build configuration.

- **What happens when a configuration key doesn't exist?**
  ‚Üí System returns the provided default value without throwing an exception.

- **What happens when credentials cannot be retrieved from OS-native storage?**
  ‚Üí System prompts user with credential dialog for re-entry and attempts to re-save to OS-native storage. This provides a user-recoverable path when storage is corrupted or permissions are revoked.

- **What happens when a feature flag doesn't exist in the registry?**
  ‚Üí System treats the feature as disabled by default and logs a warning. This prevents unexpected behavior from unconfigured features while allowing the application to run normally.

- **How does system handle concurrent configuration updates from multiple threads?**
  ‚Üí System uses thread-safe locking to prevent race conditions (already implemented).

- **What happens when environment variables contain invalid data types (e.g., "ABC" for an integer setting)?**
  ‚Üí System uses severity-based approach: (1) Non-critical settings - Uses default value, logs warning, shows status bar warning icon with details available on click; (2) Critical settings (credentials, database connection) - Shows modal dialog requiring user to correct setting before continuing. This ensures application stability while appropriately alerting users based on error impact.

- **What happens when Visual ERP credentials are valid but the API endpoint is unreachable?**
  ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is this a configuration concern or a service resilience concern? Should config system validate connectivity?]

- **What happens when OS-native secure storage is completely unavailable?**
  ‚Üí System displays user-friendly dialog explaining the storage issue in plain language (e.g., "We couldn't access your saved login information") and prompts user to enter required credentials. Application continues with user-provided credentials for the session. System attempts to re-save credentials when storage becomes available.

- **FR-029**: System MUST store Visual ERP credentials using SecretsService (not plaintext configuration).
- **FR-030**: System MUST enforce whitelist for Visual API Toolkit commands stored in application configuration file. Whitelist MUST include only read-only commands (any commands that are NOT write operations). Write commands MUST be explicitly blocked to maintain read-only access principle.
- **FR-031**: System MUST require citation format for all toolkit commands: "Reference-{File Name} - {Chapter/Section/Page}".

#### Configuration Persistence
- **FR-032**: System MUST persist user-set configuration values across application restarts using dual-storage approach: (1) Admin-configured central server path for user folders MUST be specified in a JSON configuration file (with placeholder value); default location is user's MyDocuments folder until finalized. (2) Database schema configuration file for user preferences MUST be located in the root/config folder and define table structures, column types, constraints, and relationships for user preferences storage.
- **FR-033**: System MUST NOT persist environment variable overrides (they remain environment-specific).
- **FR-034**: System MUST persist credentials in OS-native secure storage (not configuration files).

#### Error Handling and Validation

- **NFR-003**: Feature flag evaluation MUST complete in <5ms.
- **NFR-004**: Configuration change events MUST be dispatched to subscribers within 50ms of value update.

#### Security
- **NFR-005**: Credentials MUST be stored using hardware-backed encryption when available (Windows TPM, Android hardware-backed KeyStore).
- **NFR-006**: Configuration logging MUST redact sensitive keys (password, token, secret, credential).
- **NFR-007**: OS-native credential storage MUST be isolated per user account (Windows) or per application (Android).

#### Reliability
- **NFR-008**: Configuration system MUST be thread-safe for concurrent reads and writes.

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Boot Feature 001**: Core configuration infrastructure already implemented (ConfigurationService, SecretsService, FeatureFlagEvaluator)
- **MTM_Application_Launcher**: WinForms launcher application (MTM_Application_Launcher_Winforms repository) that checks version mismatches between server and local copies, prompts users to update before launching
- **MAMP MySQL**: Local MySQL 5.7 instance for Windows Desktop development
- **Visual ERP API Toolkit**: External API for read-only access to ERP data (whitelist enforcement implemented)
- **OS-Native Security APIs**: Windows DPAPI and Android KeyStore availability

### Assumptions
- Windows Desktop users have MAMP MySQL installed and running on default port 3306
- Android users will have network connectivity for API access (when API server implemented)
- Visual ERP API Toolkit credentials are provided by system administrator
- OS-native credential storage (DPAPI/KeyStore) is available and functional on target platforms
- Configuration changes at runtime are infrequent (not high-throughput scenario)
- Feature flag rollout percentages are set by developers/administrators, not end users

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

- Remote configuration server support - Not implemented
- Configuration schema validation - Not implemented
- Visual ERP master data polling and cache refresh - Not implemented
- Configuration profiles for multi-plant deployments - Not implemented
- Configuration audit logging with timestamps - Not implemented
