## üéØ Building Strategy

### What We're Building On

We're enhancing an existing system that already handles basic configuration. Think of it like upgrading a filing cabinet system to include:

- **Database Storage**: We'll save your personal settings (like display preferences and filters) in a database - similar to how your web browser remembers your preferences
- **Security System**: We'll protect sensitive information (like passwords) using your computer's built-in secure storage - like a locked vault that only you can open
- **Feature Toggle System**: We'll enable/disable features in a smart way that's consistent for each user - like having switches that stay in the same position for you
- **Error Alert System**: We'll show you helpful messages when something needs attention - from gentle reminders to important warnings

### Why These Choices?

**Database for Preferences**: We chose MySQL database because it can handle many users at once and we already use it for other data. It's fast, reliable, and our team knows it well.

**Built-in Security**: Instead of creating our own password storage (risky!), we use your operating system's secure storage. Windows has one, Android has one - they're tested, proven, and much safer than anything we could build from scratch.

**Smart Feature Toggles**: Features turn on/off consistently per user (not randomly). This prevents the confusion of seeing a feature one minute and not seeing it the next.

**Helpful Error Messages**: Not every error is critical. Minor issues get a small warning icon you can click for details. Critical issues (like "can't connect to database") show a dialog box that explains what to do in plain English.

## üèóÔ∏è Major Building Blocks

### Block 1: Configuration Storage System

**What it does**: Saves your preferences so the app "remembers" how you like things (theme, filters, sort order)

**Why it's needed**: Nobody wants to reset their preferences every time they restart the app

**How long it will take**: About 1 week (database setup + testing)

**Who works on this**: Database developer + backend developer

### Block 2: Credential Recovery Dialog

**What it does**: If the app can't retrieve your saved password (corrupted storage, permissions changed), it shows a friendly dialog asking you to enter it again

**Why it's needed**: Without this, users would be stuck if passwords couldn't be retrieved - the app would just crash or fail silently

**How long it will take**: About 3-4 days (design + build + test)

**Who works on this**: UI developer + UX designer

### Block 3: Smart Error Notifications

**What it does**: Shows you different types of messages based on how serious the problem is - from "FYI" status bar icons to "Please fix this now" dialog boxes

**Why it's needed**: Not all errors need to interrupt your work. Minor issues can wait; critical ones need immediate attention.

**How long it will take**: About 1 week (notification system + integration)

**Who works on this**: Backend developer + UI developer

### Block 4: Consistent Feature Flags

**What it does**: Makes sure that when you see a new feature enabled, it stays enabled for you (not randomly appearing/disappearing)

**Why it's needed**: Random feature behavior confuses users and makes troubleshooting impossible

**How long it will take**: About 3-4 days (algorithm change + testing)

**Who works on this**: Backend developer

### Block 5: Visual API Safety System

**What it does**: Enforces that only "read" commands can be sent to the Visual ERP system (no "write" or "delete" commands)

**Why it's needed**: Safety - we only want to read data from Visual, never change it accidentally

**How long it will take**: About 2 days (whitelist setup + validation)

**Who works on this**: Backend developer

## üìÖ Work Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal**: Set up database tables and configuration files

**What happens**:

- Create database tables for user preferences and feature flags
- Set up configuration files with placeholder values
- Write tests that define expected behavior (they'll fail at first - that's normal!)

**What you'll see**: Nothing visible yet - this is like laying the foundation of a house

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 2-3)

**Goal**: Build the main functionality

**What happens**:

- Enhance configuration system to save/load from database
- Create credential recovery dialog with clear instructions
- Implement smart error notification routing
- Upgrade feature flags to be consistent per user
- Set up Visual API command whitelist

**What you'll see**: Working features you can interact with, though not fully polished

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 4)

**Goal**: Make everything work together smoothly

**What happens**:

- Test configuration saving and loading across restarts
- Test credential recovery when storage fails
- Test error notifications with different scenarios
- Test feature flags with many users to verify consistency
- Test that only allowed API commands work

**What you'll see**: Fully working system ready for real use

### Phase 4: Polish & Documentation (Week 5)

**Goal**: Make it reliable and easy to understand

**What happens**:

- Performance testing (ensure everything is fast enough)
- Write user documentation
- Create setup guide for administrators
- Fix any remaining issues found in testing

**What you'll see**: Production-ready feature with documentation

## üîó How It Connects

### What It Talks To

**MySQL Database**: Stores your preferences so they persist when you close the app. Like saving a document - your changes are kept for next time.

**Windows/Android Security Storage**: Protects passwords using your operating system's built-in vault. Windows has Credential Manager, Android has KeyStore - both are encrypted and secure.

**MTM Application Launcher**: When new features are released, the launcher checks if there's an update and downloads new configuration. This keeps feature flags synchronized with the app version.

**Visual ERP System**: Reads data from the ERP system (part numbers, inventory, orders) but never writes back. The whitelist ensures only "read" commands are allowed.

### What Could Break

**Database Offline**: If MySQL stops running, you can't save new preferences. The app shows a clear dialog: "Database is not available. Please start MySQL and try again." You can still use the app with defaults.

**Password Storage Corrupted**: If Windows/Android secure storage has issues, the app shows a dialog asking you to re-enter your Visual ERP credentials. They'll be saved again once storage is working.

**Network Issues**: If you can't reach the Visual ERP system, the app uses cached data (if available) or shows a friendly message. The app doesn't crash - it degrades gracefully.

## üé® User Experience Approach

### How Will It Look?

We're using Material Design patterns - clean, modern, and familiar. Think Google-style interfaces: clear buttons, readable text, consistent colors.

The credential recovery dialog will have:

- Clear title: "Credentials Required"
- Plain English message: "We couldn't access your saved login information. Please enter your Visual ERP username and password to continue."
- Two text boxes (username, password) with large, easy-to-click buttons
- Helpful error messages if something's wrong

### How Will It Feel to Use?

**For minor issues**: A small warning icon appears in the status bar. Click it to see details. Doesn't interrupt your work.

**For critical issues**: A dialog box appears with clear explanation and action button. You must address it to continue (like "Start MySQL" or "Enter Password").

**Overall philosophy**: Never surprise the user. Always explain what happened and what to do about it in everyday language.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Challenges

### Things That Could Slow Us Down

**Learning Curve**: This is the first feature using the new Material Design dialog system - might take a day to get familiar.

**Database Schema Changes**: If existing database structure conflicts with our new tables, we'll need to coordinate schema changes carefully.

**Testing Coverage**: With 7 different integration scenarios, testing will take time. We'll need the MAMP MySQL server running reliably for tests.

### Our Backup Plans

**Material Design Issues**: If the new dialog system is problematic, we fall back to standard Avalonia dialogs (simpler, but less polished). Adds 1-2 days.

**Schema Conflicts**: We have a rollback script ready. If new tables cause issues, we can revert and redesign. Adds 3-5 days.

**MySQL Stability**: If MAMP is unreliable for testing, we switch to Docker MySQL container (more consistent). Adds 1 day for setup.

## üìä Quality Measures

### How We'll Know It's Ready

**Speed Tests**:

- Configuration lookup: Under 10 milliseconds (instant - you won't notice any delay)
- Password retrieval: Under 100 milliseconds (faster than you can blink)
- Feature flag check: Under 5 milliseconds (instant)

**Accuracy Tests**:

- 100 users with feature flag at 50% rollout = approximately 50 see it enabled (consistent for each user)
- Save 100 preferences to database, restart app, all 100 load correctly
- Corrupt password storage, credential dialog appears with clear message

**User Experience Tests**:

- 5 actual users try credential recovery dialog without instructions - all succeed
- Minor configuration error shows status bar warning (non-intrusive)
- Critical database error shows modal dialog with clear action steps

### What "Done" Looks Like

- ‚úÖ All planned features work as described in specification
- ‚úÖ All 7 test scenarios pass without errors
- ‚úÖ Performance targets met (<10ms, <100ms, <5ms)
- ‚úÖ No crashes when database offline or passwords missing
- ‚úÖ Error messages use plain English (no technical jargon like "CryptographicException")
- ‚úÖ Feature flags are deterministic (same user always sees same result)
- ‚úÖ Documentation written for developers and administrators
- ‚úÖ Team trained on how configuration system works

## üéì Key Terms Explained

**Configuration System**: The part of the app that remembers your preferences (like theme, default filters, sort order)

**Credential Storage**: Secure place where passwords are kept (using your operating system's built-in encryption)

**Feature Flag**: A switch that turns features on or off without changing code (lets us release features gradually)

**Database Persistence**: Saving data to a database so it survives when you close the app

**Contract Test**: A test that validates data structure and behavior (like a checklist ensuring everything matches specifications)

**Integration Test**: A test that validates complete workflows end-to-end (like following a real user's journey through the app)

**Deterministic Rollout**: Ensuring the same user always sees the same features enabled (not random)

**Modal Dialog**: A dialog box that requires your attention before you can continue (blocks other interactions until addressed)

**Status Bar Indicator**: A small icon or message in the bottom bar that doesn't interrupt your work
