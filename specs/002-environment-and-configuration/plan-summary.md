## üéØ Building Strategy

### What We're Building On

**Settings System with Smart Memory**: We're creating a system that remembers application settings (like database connections, file locations) and can be overridden by environment variables - think of it like having default preferences that you can customize per computer.

**Secure Credential Vault**: We're using your computer's built-in security (Windows Credential Manager on Windows, KeyStore on Android) to safely store passwords and API keys - like using your operating system's password manager instead of writing passwords on sticky notes.

**Feature Control Center**: We're building a system that checks which features are turned on/off from a central database at startup - like a settings dashboard that controls which buttons appear in the app.

### Why These Choices?

**Industry-Standard Patterns**: We're using Microsoft's recommended approach for configuration (appsettings.json + environment variables) because it's proven, well-documented, and our team knows it well. This means faster development and fewer surprises.

**Operating System Security**: By using Windows/Android's built-in credential storage, we're not reinventing the wheel. The OS has already solved this problem securely, so we're leveraging what's already there.

**Simplicity Over Complexity**: We decided feature flags only update at app startup (not while running) because it's simpler and more predictable. If you change a flag, restart the app - just like changing system settings.

## üèóÔ∏è Major Building Blocks

This section breaks down the work into major pieces, like building a house room by room.

### Block 1: Configuration System

**What it does**: Reads application settings from files and environment variables, automatically preferring environment variables when both exist.

**Why it's needed**: So developers can override database connections or file paths without editing code, and so the app works in different environments (development, staging, production).

**How long it will take**: About 1 week (6 tasks)

**Who works on this**: Configuration developer

**Business value**: Faster deployments, fewer configuration mistakes, easier troubleshooting

### Block 2: Credential Storage

**What it does**: Securely stores and retrieves passwords, API keys, and other secrets using the operating system's secure storage.

**Why it's needed**: So credentials aren't stored in plain text files where hackers could find them. The OS protects them with hardware encryption.

**How long it will take**: About 1.5 weeks (7 tasks)

**Who works on this**: Security developer

**Business value**: Meets security compliance requirements, protects sensitive data, reduces breach risk

### Block 3: Feature Flag System

**What it does**: Checks a database at app startup to see which features are enabled, caches them in memory, and provides a simple "is this feature on?" check.

**Why it's needed**: So we can turn features on/off without deploying new code, test features with small user groups, or quickly disable problematic features.

**How long it will take**: About 1 week (6 tasks)

**Who works on this**: Backend developer

**Business value**: Faster incident response, safer feature rollouts, easier A/B testing

### Block 4: Database Foundation

**What it does**: Creates three database tables (Users, UserPreferences, FeatureFlags) to store user settings and feature flags.

**Why it's needed**: So settings and flags persist across app restarts and are shared across devices.

**How long it will take**: About 0.5 weeks (5 tasks)

**Who works on this**: Database developer

**Business value**: Centralized settings management, consistent user experience across devices

## üìÖ Work Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal**: Set up database, models, and contracts

**What happens**:
- Create database tables (Users, UserPreferences, FeatureFlags)
- Define data models in code (what a "UserPreference" looks like)
- Write contract tests (verify interfaces are correct before implementing)
- Update database documentation

**What you'll see**: Not much visible yet - this is like laying the foundation of a house

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 2-3)

**Goal**: Build the three main systems (Configuration, Credentials, Feature Flags)

**What happens**:
- Implement configuration service with precedence rules (environment variables beat file settings)
- Implement Windows credential storage using DPAPI (Data Protection API)
- Implement Android credential storage using KeyStore
- Implement feature flag evaluator with database sync
- Wire up dependency injection (so services can talk to each other)

**What you'll see**: Services work but aren't connected to UI yet - you can test them with automated tests

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 4)

**Goal**: Make sure everything works together reliably

**What happens**:
- Test credential recovery flow (what happens when Windows Credential Manager is corrupted?)
- Test offline scenarios (what happens when database is unreachable?)
- Test configuration precedence (does environment variable really override file?)
- Test feature flag sync (does database change reflect in app after restart?)
- Performance testing (<3 seconds startup, <100ms configuration retrieval)

**What you'll see**: Fully functional feature ready for real use, with evidence it handles problems gracefully

## üîó How It Connects

### What It Talks To

**MySQL Database**: Reads user preferences and feature flags from MAMP MySQL 5.7 database running locally (127.0.0.1:3306)

**Windows Credential Manager** (Windows only): Stores and retrieves credentials using built-in OS security

**Android KeyStore** (Android only): Stores and retrieves credentials using Android's secure storage

**Configuration Files**: Reads appsettings.json file for default settings

**Environment Variables**: Reads system environment variables for deployment-specific overrides

### What Could Break

**Database Offline**: If MySQL database is unreachable, the app uses cached feature flags (from last successful sync) and shows a warning. Configuration and credentials still work normally.

**Credential Storage Corrupted**: If Windows Credential Manager has problems, the app prompts the user to re-enter credentials and attempts to re-save them. The user isn't blocked from using the app.

**Invalid Configuration Values**: If an environment variable has the wrong format (e.g., "ABC" instead of a number), the app logs a warning and uses the default value from appsettings.json.

**Network Partition**: Android devices without network access can't sync feature flags, so they use whatever flags were cached last time they had connectivity. The app detects "offline mode" and adjusts behavior accordingly.

---

## üé® User Experience Approach

### How Will It Look?

**Mostly Invisible**: This is a behind-the-scenes feature - users won't see much UI except:
- Credential recovery dialog if Windows Credential Manager fails
- Subtle status indicators showing "online" vs "offline" mode
- Settings screen showing active feature flags (for troubleshooting)

**Error Messages**: When something goes wrong, users see helpful messages like "We couldn't connect to the database. Using your last saved settings..." instead of cryptic error codes.

### How Will It Feel to Use?

**Fast and Seamless**: Configuration retrieval takes less than 100 milliseconds - so fast you won't notice. Feature flags are cached in memory, so checking "is this feature enabled?" is instant.

**Reliable Offline**: The app works offline by using cached settings and credentials. Users don't get stuck with "network error" messages that block them from working.

**Self-Healing**: If credentials are corrupted, the app prompts for re-entry instead of crashing. If the database is down, the app uses cached flags instead of showing blank screens.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Challenges

### Things That Could Slow Us Down

**Platform-Specific Testing**: We need to test credential storage on both Windows (DPAPI) and Android (KeyStore) - requires setting up both environments and devices for testing. **Mitigation**: Use factory pattern to abstract platform differences, write extensive contract tests to catch issues early.

**Database Connection Edge Cases**: Many scenarios to test (database down, network partition, slow queries, corrupted data). **Mitigation**: Use established patterns from Feature 001 (boot sequence) which already handles similar scenarios.

**Environment Variable Syntax**: Different operating systems handle environment variables differently (Windows uses `%VAR%`, Linux uses `$VAR`). **Mitigation**: .NET's configuration system abstracts these differences - we test on all platforms.

**Credential Recovery UX**: Prompting users for credentials is disruptive - need to make dialog clear and non-threatening. **Mitigation**: Use friendly language ("Let's reconnect to your secure storage"), provide context about what happened, make "cancel" option work gracefully.

## üéì What We Learned (Research Phase)

During the planning phase, we researched 10 areas and made these key decisions:

1. **Configuration Storage**: Use Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration (industry standard) instead of custom JSON parser
2. **Credential Storage**: Use OS-native security (DPAPI/KeyStore) instead of encrypted files (less secure)
3. **Feature Flags**: Launch-time-only sync (simplicity) instead of real-time hot-reload (complexity)
4. **Error Handling**: Result<T> pattern (functional approach) instead of exception-only (loses context)
5. **Database**: Normalized schema with foreign keys (data integrity) instead of NoSQL (overkill)
6. **Platform Detection**: RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform() (built-in) instead of #if directives (hard to test)
7. **Precedence**: Environment variables override files (12-factor app) instead of merge logic (complex)
8. **Recovery**: User prompt on failure (self-healing) instead of crash (poor UX)
9. **Testing**: Contract-first TDD (design-by-contract) instead of implementation-first (violates principles)
10. **Logging**: Serilog structured logs (debuggability) instead of Console.WriteLine (unstructured)

Each decision prioritized **simplicity**, **reliability**, and **following established patterns** over custom solutions.
