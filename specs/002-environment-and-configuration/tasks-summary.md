## üéØ Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

**Goal**: Get the project ready for development - like setting up a new workspace before starting work

**What success looks like**: All configuration files exist, database is set up, and developers can start coding

### Task 1: Create Configuration Files ‚è≥

**What it means**: Set up the instruction files that tell the system where to find things and how to behave

**Who does it**: Lead developer

**Time estimate**: 1 hour / 2 hours

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

**What you'll see when done**:
- Two new folders appear in the project: `config/`
- Inside are files that tell the app where user folders are located and how the database should be structured
- Files have placeholder text that will be replaced later with real values

**Status**: Not started

---

### Task 2: Generate Database Setup Scripts ‚è≥

## üß™ Phase 2: Testing Framework

**Goal**: Write tests that will check if everything works correctly - think of it like writing the answer key before taking a test

**What success looks like**: We have automated tests that can verify the system works as designed

**Q**: Should feature flags sync in real-time?
**A**: No, only on application updates via launcher to keep experience stable

**Q**: What happens if user's saved passwords are corrupted?
**A**: Show dialog asking them to re-enter, then save again securely

### Still Need Answers

## üéì Translation Guide (Technical ‚Üí Plain Language)

This feature uses some technical concepts that might need explanation:

- **Configuration precedence** = The order in which the system looks for settings (environment variables checked first, then user settings, then defaults)
- **Deterministic rollout** = Feature flags that give the same result for the same user every time (not random)
- **OS-native secure storage** = Using Windows or Android's built-in password encryption (not custom encryption)
- **Contract tests** = Tests that verify data structures match expected format (like checking answers against an answer key)
- **Integration tests** = Tests that verify multiple components work together correctly
- **Performance tests** = Tests that measure speed and confirm system is fast enough
- **CompiledBinding** = A fast way to connect UI to code (catches errors at compile time, not runtime)
- **MVVM pattern** = A code organization approach that separates visual design from business logic
- **Nullable reference types** = Explicit marking of which variables can be null/empty (prevents crashes)
