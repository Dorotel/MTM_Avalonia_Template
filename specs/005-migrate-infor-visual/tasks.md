## Dependencies & Execution Order

**Tests**: Test-first workflow is mandatory (see plan.md constitution check). Each phase lists tests that MUST be implemented before feature code.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by phase with clear dependencies. Phases 1-4 are NEW (Custom Controls, Settings, Debug Terminal, Config Dialog). Phases 5-11 are VISUAL integration (existing content renumbered).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

1. **Setup (Phase 5 - VISUAL)** → prerequisite for foundation.
2. **Foundation (Phase 6 - VISUAL)** → blocks all VISUAL user stories until complete.
3. **User Stories**:
   - **US5 Part Lookup (P1, Phase 7)** starts immediately after foundation and delivers MVP.
   - **US6 Work Orders (P1, Phase 8)** can start after foundation; integrates with US5 but remains independently testable.
   - **US7 Inventory (P2, Phase 9)** depends on US5/US6 repositories and transaction scaffolding.
   - **US8 Shipments (P2, Phase 10)** depends on US6 (navigation patterns) and US7 (transaction persistence helpers).
   - **US9 Offline (P3, Phase 11)** depends on all prior stories for UI hooks and repositories.
4. **Polish (Phase 12)** follows completion of desired user stories and final integration validation.

**Story Dependencies Graph**:
- Foundation → US5 → US6 → US7 → US8 → US9 → Polish
- US7 also requires US6's repository extensions; US8 builds on US7's transaction persistence.ies**:

1. **Phase 1 (Custom Controls)** - FOUNDATION for all subsequent phases. No dependencies.
2. **Phase 2 (Settings UI)** - Depends on Phase 1 (uses SettingsCategory, SettingRow, ActionButtonGroup controls).
3. **Phase 3 (Debug Terminal)** - Depends on Phase 1 (uses StatusCard, MetricDisplay, ErrorListPanel, BootTimelineChart, NavigationMenuItem, ActionButtonGroup controls). Independent of Phase 2.
4. **Phase 4 (Config Dialog)** - Depends on Phase 1 (uses ConfigurationErrorDialog, ActionButtonGroup controls) and Phase 2 (integrates with Settings window).
5. **Phase 5 (VISUAL Setup)** - Independent of Phases 1-4 (but Phases 1-4 should be complete before starting VISUAL work).
6. **Phase 6 (VISUAL Foundation)** - Depends on Phase 5, blocks all VISUAL user stories.
7. **Phase 7 (US5 Part Lookup)** - Depends on Phase 6, delivers MVP.
8. **Phase 8 (US6 Work Orders)** - Depends on Phase 6, independent of Phase 7 but integrates with US5 navigation.
9. **Phase 9 (US7 Inventory)** - Depends on Phases 7 & 8 (uses repositories and transaction patterns).
10. **Phase 10 (US8 Shipments)** - Depends on Phases 8 & 9 (uses repository extensions and transaction persistence).
11. **Phase 11 (US9 Offline/Performance)** - Depends on all prior phases (adds monitoring to all VISUAL operations).
12. **Phase 12 (Polish)** - Depends on completion of desired user stories, final integration validation.

**Critical Path**:
```
Phase 1 (Custom Controls)
├─→ Phase 2 (Settings UI)
│   └─→ Phase 4 (Config Dialog)
├─→ Phase 3 (Debug Terminal) [independent of Phase 2]
└─→ Phase 5 (VISUAL Setup)
    └─→ Phase 6 (VISUAL Foundation)
        └─→ Phase 7 (US5 Part Lookup) [MVP]
            ├─→ Phase 8 (US6 Work Orders)
            │   ├─→ Phase 9 (US7 Inventory)
            │   │   └─→ Phase 10 (US8 Shipments)
            │   │       └─→ Phase 11 (US9 Offline/Performance)
            │   │           └─→ Phase 12 (Polish)
```

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Phase 1 → Phase 6 → Phase 7 (Custom Controls → VISUAL Foundation → Part Lookup)

**Recommended Delivery Sequence**:
1. Complete Phases 1-4 first (Custom Controls, Settings, Debug Terminal, Config Dialog) - Immediate value, independent of VISUAL
2. Then Phases 5-7 (VISUAL Setup/Foundation/Part Lookup) - MVP VISUAL integration
3. Then Phases 8-11 (Work Orders, Inventory, Shipments, Offline) - Full VISUAL integration
4. Finally Phase 12 (Polish) - Documentation and release preparationplan.md constitution check). Each phase lists tests that MUST be implemented before feature code.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by phase with clear dependencies. Phases 1-4 are NEW (Custom Controls, Settings, Debug Terminal, Config Dialog). Phases 5-11 are VISUAL integration (existing content renumbered).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Phase]**: Which phase the task belongs to (Phase 1-11)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions for quick navigation

## Phase 5: VISUAL Integration - Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Phase 5: VISUAL Integration - Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare solution-level prerequisites required before implementing VISUAL integration.

- [ ] T098 [Phase5-Setup] Add Windows-only references to the Infor VISUAL API Toolkit assemblies (9 DLLs) in `MTM_Template_Application/MTM_Template_Application.csproj` and `MTM_Template_Application.Desktop/MTM_Template_Application.Desktop.csproj`. Use `<Reference Include="[DllName]">` with `HintPath` pointing to `..\..\docs\Visual Files\ReferenceFiles\[DllName].dll` for each: LsaCore, LsaShared, VmfgFinancials, VmfgInventory, VmfgPurchasing, VmfgSales, VmfgShared, VmfgShopFloor, VmfgTrace. Set `<Private>True</Private>` and `<CopyLocal>True</CopyLocal>` for each reference. **Note**: DLLs are already available locally in repository - no external installation required.
- [ ] T099 [Phase5-Setup] Introduce a `VisualIntegration` configuration section in `MTM_Template_Application/appsettings.json` (performance thresholds, cache TTL overrides, degradation settings) and update `Services/Configuration/ConfigurationService.cs` to expose strongly typed options.

---

## Phase 6: VISUAL Integration - Foundation (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure required by all VISUAL features. No user-story work may start until these tasks are complete.

- [ ] T100 [P] [Phase6-Foundation] Add Visual domain models (`Part`, `WorkOrder`, `InventoryTransaction`, `CustomerOrder`, `ShipmentStatus`, nested types, `VisualPerformanceMetrics`) under `MTM_Template_Application/Models/Visual/`, matching `data-model.md` nullability rules.
- [ ] T101 [P] [Phase6-Foundation] Create `LocalTransactionRecord` model and `LocalTransactionType` enum with JSON serialization helpers in `Models/Visual/LocalTransactionRecord.cs` to represent MAMP MySQL audit records.
- [ ] T102 [Phase6-Foundation] Register `VisualIntegrationOptions` POCOs and bind them inside `Services/Configuration/ConfigurationService.cs`, exposing accessors for response thresholds, cache TTL, and degradation limits.
- [ ] T103 [Phase6-Foundation] Define `IVisualApiService` plus filter DTOs (`PartSearchFilter`, `WorkOrderFilter`, `CustomerOrderFilter`) in `Services/Visual/IVisualApiService.cs` aligned with research.md abstractions.
- [ ] T104 [Phase6-Foundation] Scaffold `Services/Visual/VisualApiService.cs` with dependency injection, Polly retry policies, whitelist validation, structured logging hooks, and method stubs for all planned operations (throw `NotImplementedException` until stories fill them in).
- [ ] T105 [Phase6-Foundation] Implement `Services/Cache/VisualCacheService.cs` to wrap `CacheService`, enforce TTL policies (24h parts, 7d others), and provide helpers for cache keys defined in `data-model.md`.
- [ ] T106 [Phase6-Foundation] Create `Services/DataLayer/LocalTransactionRepository.cs` with parameterized CRUD scaffolding targeting `LocalTransactionRecords`, including serialization helpers and cancellation support.
- [ ] T107 [Phase6-Foundation] Document the `LocalTransactionRecords` table in `.github/mamp-database/schema-tables.json` and append the migration reference to `.github/mamp-database/migrations-history.json`.
- [ ] T108 [Phase6-Foundation] Add `Services/Visual/VisualServiceExtensions.cs` plus register Visual services/repositories/options in DI, updating `MTM_Template_Application.Desktop/Program.cs` to call the extension.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready — user stories can now proceed in priority order.

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Part Lookup (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable operators to scan or enter a part number and retrieve VISUAL part details (description, on-hand inventory, location, specifications) within 3 seconds, with cached fallback when offline.

**Independent Test**: Scan part “12345-ABC” (or use sample from quickstart) → part details load within 3 seconds online, within 1 second offline with “Last updated” timestamp.

### Tests for User Story 5 (Phase 7) (write first)

- [ ] T109 [P] [US5] Extend `tests/contract/VisualApiContractTests.cs` with CT-PART-001/002 contract tests covering `GetPartByIdAsync` and `SearchPartsAsync` against the VISUAL API Toolkit abstraction.
- [ ] T110 [P] [US5] Add `tests/integration/VisualPartLookupIntegrationTests.cs` validating cache-first lookup, live fallback, and offline banner behavior using `VisualCacheService`.
- [ ] T111 [P] [US5] Create `tests/unit/ViewModels/PartLookupViewModelTests.cs` to cover command enablement, barcode search workflow, and error handling.

### Implementation for User Story 9 (Phase 11) (Phase 7)

- [ ] T112 [P] [US5] Implement part operations in `Services/Visual/VisualApiService.cs` and add `VisualPartsRepository.cs` to translate toolkit data, integrate caching, and enforce whitelist.
- [ ] T113 [US5] Add `ViewModels/PartLookupViewModel.cs` using CommunityToolkit source generators, injecting repositories, cache service, and configuration options.
- [ ] T114 [US5] Create `Views/PartLookupView.axaml` (+ code-behind) with compiled bindings, search input, results grid, cached indicators, and barcode scan affordances following theme guidelines.
- [ ] T115 [US5] Update `Views/MainView.axaml` and `ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs` to host the part lookup experience (replace placeholder dashboard content) and surface offline/cached banners.
- [ ] T116 [US5] Register Part Lookup view + view model in DI/navigation (`Program.cs`, `Services/Navigation`, and `ViewLocator.cs`) so it loads as the default manufacturing workspace.

**Checkpoint**: Part lookup flow fully functional and independently demoable.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

1. **Setup (Phase 1)** → prerequisite for foundation.
2. **Foundation (Phase 2)** → blocks all user stories until complete.
3. **User Stories**:
   - **US1 (P1)** starts immediately after foundation and delivers MVP.
   - **US2 (P1)** can start after foundation; integrates with US1 but remains independently testable.
   - **US3 (P2)** depends on US1/US2 repositories and transaction scaffolding.
   - **US4 (P2)** depends on US2 (navigation patterns) and US3 (transaction persistence helpers).
   - **US5 (P3)** depends on all prior stories for UI hooks and repositories.
4. **Polish (Phase 8)** follows completion of desired user stories and final integration validation.

**Story Dependencies Graph**:
- Foundation → US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5 → Polish
- US3 also requires US2’s repository extensions; US4 builds on US3’s transaction persistence.

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 7: User Story 5 - Part Lookup
- **Parallel Tests**: T109, T110, T111 can be authored simultaneously (different files).
- **Parallel Implementation**: T112 (service/repository) and T114 (view) can progress in parallel once T113 (view model contract) is defined.

### Phase 8: User Story 6 - Work Orders
- **Parallel Tests**: T117, T118, T119.
- **Parallel Implementation**: T120 (service) and T121 (repository persistence) can proceed together; T122/T123 require both to finish.

### Phase 9: User Story 7 - Inventory
- **Parallel Tests**: T126, T127, T128.
- **Parallel Implementation**: T129 (service) and T131 (validator) can be built concurrently, feeding into T132/T133.

### Phase 10: User Story 8 - Shipments
- **Parallel Tests**: T135, T136, T137.
- **Parallel Implementation**: T138 (service) and T139 (repository extension) unblock T140/T141.

### Phase 11: User Story 9 - Offline/Performance
- **Parallel Tests**: T143, T144, T145.
- **Parallel Implementation**: T146 (performance monitor) and T147 (degradation detector) can progress concurrently; T150 (UI) waits for both.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP First**: Complete Setup → Foundation → US5 Part Lookup (Phase 7). Verify part lookup end-to-end before continuing.
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Add US6 for work orders (still shippable), then US7 for inventory, US8 for shipments, and finally US9 for offline/performance extras.
3. **Quality Gates**: Each story completes with tests first, structured logging, and DI registration. Run validation script + targeted tests at every checkpoint.
4. **Documentation & Telemetry**: Update docs and success metrics in Polish phase to capture operational expectations (response times, cached usage, degradation controls).
