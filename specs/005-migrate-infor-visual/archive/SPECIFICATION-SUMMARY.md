- SettingDefinition and SettingCategory (settings models)
- VisualPart, VisualWorkOrder, WorkOrderOperation (VISUAL data models)
- InventoryTransaction, LocalTransactionRecord (transaction models)
- PerformanceSnapshot, ErrorLogEntry (diagnostic models)

### Success Criteria (20 Measurable Outcomes)
- SC-101 to SC-104: Custom controls metrics
- SC-201 to SC-205: Settings management metrics
- SC-301 to SC-305: Debug Terminal metrics
- SC-401 to SC-403: Error handling metrics
- SC-501 to SC-508: VISUAL integration metrics
- SC-601 to SC-605: Overall feature validation

### Implementation Phases (6 Phases)
1. **Phase 1**: Custom Controls Foundation (5-7 days, Medium risk)
2. **Phase 2**: Settings UI (4-6 days, Low risk)
3. **Phase 3**: Debug Terminal Rewrite (6-8 days, High risk)
4. **Phase 4**: Configuration Error Dialog (2-3 days, Low risk)
5. **Phase 5**: VISUAL ERP Integration (10-14 days, High risk)
6. **Phase 6**: Integration & Testing (3-5 days, Medium risk)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 30-44 days

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Debug Terminal rewrite, mega-feature scope, VISUAL API complexity
- **Medium Risk**: Custom controls backward compatibility, settings persistence edge cases
- **Low Risk**: Configuration error dialog, barcode scanning

### Dependencies
- External: Infor VISUAL API Toolkit, MySQL Database, barcode scanner hardware
- Internal: Feature 002 (Configuration Service), Feature 003 (Debug Terminal), Constitution Principle XI
- Package: Avalonia, MVVM Toolkit, MySql.Data, LZ4, Polly, Serilog, xUnit, NSubstitute, FluentAssertions

## Key Decisions Captured

### Scope Decision: All-In-One Mega-Feature
**Decision**: Implement all five workstreams in single feature branch
**Rationale**: High risk, high reward approach delivers complete manufacturing solution
**Impact**: 3-5x larger than split approach, estimated 30-44 days total
**Risk Mitigation**: Phased implementation, extensive testing, Radio Silence Mode

### Custom Controls Extraction Strategy
**Decision**: Aggressive extraction with 3+ occurrence threshold
**Rationale**: Matches Constitution Principle XI default, DebugTerminalWindow has 50+ repeated patterns
**Impact**: 10+ controls to extract, 60%+ XAML duplication reduction target

### Settings UI Organization
**Decision**: Tabbed categories (General, Database, VISUAL ERP, Advanced, Developer)
**Rationale**: Familiar pattern, reduces cognitive load, logical grouping
**Impact**: 60+ settings organized, Save/Cancel transaction pattern required

### Debug Terminal Approach
**Decision**: Complete rewrite from scratch
**Rationale**: Opportunity to redesign cleanly with custom controls
**Impact**: HIGH RISK but cleaner result, maintain functional equivalence

### VISUAL Integration Mode
**Decision**: Read-only integration only, MAMP MySQL as system of record
**Rationale**: Security policy, no write operations to VISUAL server
**Impact**: All user-entered transactions persist to MAMP MySQL, no sync to VISUAL

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: Test-first (TDD) with 80%+ coverage target
**Rationale**: Constitution Principle IV requirement, prevents regressions
**Impact**: Tests written before implementation for all ViewModels, services, controls
