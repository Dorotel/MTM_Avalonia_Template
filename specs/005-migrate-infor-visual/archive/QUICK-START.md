# Feature 005: Quick Start with Spec-Kit Commands

**Your current status**: ‚úÖ Prep work complete, ready to generate specification

---

## The 7-Step Workflow (30-Second Overview)

```
Step 1: /constitution  ‚úÖ (Already done - Constitution v1.1.0 exists)
Step 2: /specify       ‚è≥ (Next step - generate SPEC_005.md)
Step 3: /clarify       ‚è≥ (Resolve ambiguities)
Step 4: /plan          ‚è≥ (Generate technical plan)
Step 5: /tasks         ‚è≥ (Generate task breakdown)
Step 6: /analyze       ‚è≥ (Validate consistency)
Step 7: /implement     ‚è≥ (Execute in Radio Silence Mode)
```

## Your Immediate Next Steps (Today)

### Step 1: Generate Specification (15 minutes)

Run this command:

```
/specify using prompt file: specs/005-migrate-infor-visual/RESTART-PROMPT.md
```

**What this does**:
- Reads your RESTART-PROMPT.md (890 lines)
- References all 6 reference files (~2500 lines of context)
- Incorporates your 21 Q&A answers
- Generates comprehensive SPEC_005.md with:
  - User stories (prioritized P1-P5)
  - Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-100+)
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Edge cases
  - Performance/security requirements

**Expected output**: `specs/005-migrate-infor-visual/SPEC_005.md`

---

### Step 2: Review Specification (1-2 hours)

Open and review `SPEC_005.md`:

- ‚úÖ Check user stories match your intent
- ‚úÖ Verify functional requirements are complete
- ‚úÖ Look for `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
- ‚úÖ Confirm acceptance criteria are testable
- ‚úÖ Validate performance budgets

**If satisfied**: Proceed to Step 3

**If changes needed**: Edit SPEC_005.md directly, then proceed

---

### Step 3: Clarify Ambiguities (1-2 hours)

Run this command:

```
/clarify
```

**What this does**:
- Scans SPEC_005.md for ambiguities
- Identifies `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
- Generates clarification questions
- Waits for your answers

**Example questions** (from RESTART-GUIDE.md):
1. Visual API Endpoint: Actual URL or mock service?
2. Database Credentials: Editable in Settings UI?
3. Feature Flags: Toggleable in Settings UI?
4. Debug Terminal: Main menu or hidden?
5. Settings Export: Include credentials?

**After answering**:
- Update SPEC_005.md with clarified details
- Remove all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
- Commit: `git commit -am "chore: clarify Feature 005 requirements"`

---

## Tomorrow's Steps

### Step 4: Generate Technical Plan (2-3 hours)

```
/plan for feature: 005-migrate-infor-visual
```

**Expected output**: `PLAN_005.md` with architecture, phases, file structure

---

### Step 5: Generate Task Breakdown (3-4 hours)

```
/tasks for feature: 005-migrate-infor-visual
```

**Expected output**: `TASKS_005.md` with 120-150 granular tasks

---

### Step 6: Validate Consistency (1-2 hours)

```
/analyze feature: 005-migrate-infor-visual
```

**Expected output**: `ANALYSIS_005.md` with coverage report

---

## Next Week: Implementation

### Step 7: Execute Implementation (3-5 weeks)

```
/implement feature: 005-migrate-infor-visual --mode=radio-silence
```

**What happens**:
- Agent enters Radio Silence Mode
- Implements tasks in order (PATCH output only)
- Runs tests after each task
- Updates progress in TASKS_005.md
- Exits with SUMMARY when complete

## Key Files You've Already Created

‚úÖ **RESTART-PROMPT.md** (890 lines) - Main prompt file

‚úÖ **reference/README.md** (~300 lines) - Reference index

‚úÖ **reference/REFERENCE-CLARIFICATIONS.md** (~200 lines) - Your Q&A answers

‚úÖ **reference/REFERENCE-EXISTING-PATTERNS.md** (~400 lines) - Code patterns

‚úÖ **reference/REFERENCE-CUSTOM-CONTROLS.md** (~450 lines) - 10 controls

‚úÖ **reference/REFERENCE-SETTINGS-INVENTORY.md** (~400 lines) - 60+ settings

‚úÖ **reference/REFERENCE-CONSTITUTIONAL-REQUIREMENTS.md** (~550 lines) - Compliance

‚úÖ **reference/REFERENCE-VISUAL-API-SCOPE.md** (~500 lines) - API contracts

**Total context**: ~4,400 lines ready for spec generation

---

## Timeline Estimates

### Specification Phase (Steps 2-6)

- **Today**: Specify + Clarify (3-4 hours)
- **Tomorrow**: Plan + Tasks + Analyze (6-8 hours)
- **Total**: ~2 days for complete specification

### Implementation Phase (Step 7)

- **Optimistic**: 3-4 weeks
- **Realistic**: 4-5 weeks
- **Pessimistic**: 5-6 weeks

**Total Feature 005**: ~5-6 weeks from start to completion

## What Makes This Different from Normal Development?

### Traditional Approach
```
Write code ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Fix bugs ‚Üí Repeat ‚Üí Hope it works
```

### Spec-Kit Approach
```
Specify requirements ‚Üí Plan architecture ‚Üí Break into tasks ‚Üí
Validate consistency ‚Üí Implement with tests ‚Üí Guaranteed success
```

**Key Differences**:
- ‚úÖ **Requirements first** (not code first)
- ‚úÖ **Test-driven** (tests before implementation)
- ‚úÖ **Validated upfront** (catch issues before coding)
- ‚úÖ **Traceable** (every requirement maps to tasks)
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous** (Radio Silence Mode for focus)

## Why This Works for Feature 005

### Your Feature is LARGE (All-in-One Mega-Feature)

- 5 phases (Custom Controls, Settings, Debug Terminal, Error Dialog, VISUAL)
- 120-150 tasks estimated
- 10 custom controls to extract/create
- 60+ settings requiring UI
- 3 Visual API data contracts
- 3-5x larger than split approach

### Without Spec-Kit
- ‚ùå Easy to lose track of progress
- ‚ùå Hard to validate completeness
- ‚ùå Risk of missing requirements
- ‚ùå Difficult to estimate timeline
- ‚ùå Rework when discovering gaps

### With Spec-Kit
- ‚úÖ Every requirement documented
- ‚úÖ Every task tracked
- ‚úÖ Progress visible
- ‚úÖ Gaps identified upfront
- ‚úÖ Timebox management

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I edit the generated files?

**Yes!** All generated files (SPEC, PLAN, TASKS) are markdown files you can edit directly.

### Q: What if clarify finds nothing?

**Great!** That means your spec is clear. Proceed to `/plan`.

### Q: Can I split implementation into phases?

**Yes!** You can approve Phase 1-2 completion, then resume later for Phase 3-5.

### Q: What if I disagree with the plan?

**Edit PLAN_005.md** directly. The plan is a living document.

### Q: How do I track progress during implementation?

**Check TASKS_005.md** - agent updates task status after each completion.
