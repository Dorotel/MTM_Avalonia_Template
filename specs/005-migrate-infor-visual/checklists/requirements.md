- [x] **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: ✅ Criteria focus on user outcomes and business value, not implementation details
- [x] **Success criteria include measurement method**: ✅ All criteria specify how to measure (performance telemetry, user observation study, error report comparison)

### Clarity & Ambiguity
- [x] **Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: ✅ ALL CLARIFICATIONS RESOLVED (4 questions answered in Session 2025-10-08)
- [x] **Clarification markers specific and actionable**: ✅ All clarification questions answered with concrete decisions and implementation guidance
- [x] **No placeholder text remains**: ✅ All template placeholders replaced with concrete content

**Feature Readiness Score**: 7/7 (100%)

## Clarification Resolution Summary (Session 2025-10-08)

### Resolved Questions

1. **Q1: Authentication Mechanism (FR-009)** - ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Answer**: Username/Password stored in Windows Credential Manager via WindowsSecretsService (DPAPI encryption)
   - **Status**: Already implemented - no development required
   - **Impact**: Removed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker from FR-009

2. **Q2: Cache Retention Period (FR-015)** - ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Answer**: Parts: 24 hours | Other entities: 7 days (via CacheStalenessDetector)
   - **Status**: Already implemented - no development required
   - **Impact**: Removed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker from FR-015, added specific TTL values

3. **Q3: Write Operations & Authorization (CRITICAL)** - ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Answer**: VISUAL API Toolkit is READ-ONLY (management policy). All write operations (work orders, inventory, shipments) persist to MAMP MySQL only.
   - **Status**: Major architectural clarification
   - **Impact**:
     - Added FR-016 (read-only enforcement)
     - Added FR-017 (MAMP MySQL as system of record)
     - Updated FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-007, FR-008, FR-012 to reflect local-only writes
     - Updated all user stories to remove "sync to VISUAL" language
     - Changed entity "Local Transaction Queue Entry" → "Local Transaction Record" (permanent storage)

4. **Q4: Performance Monitoring & Observability** - ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Answer**: Hybrid approach - Silent structured logging PLUS user-facing performance indicators in DebugTerminalWindow.axaml
   - **Status**: New requirements added for implementation
   - **Impact**:
     - Added FR-019 (Hybrid performance monitoring)
     - Added FR-020 (Automatic degradation mode)
     - Added FR-021 (DebugTerminalWindow.axaml integration requirements)

## Overall Assessment

| Category                  | Score     | Status |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Content Quality           | 6/6 (100%) | ✅ PASS |
| Requirement Completeness  | 8/8 (100%) | ✅ PASS |
| Feature Readiness         | 7/7 (100%) | ✅ PASS |
| **TOTAL**                 | **21/21 (100%)** | **✅ PASS** |

## Validation Result

**✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING PHASE**

All clarification questions have been resolved. The specification now includes:
- 18 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-021, with FR-018 reserved)
- 5 user stories with concrete acceptance criteria
- 6 success criteria with measurement methods
- 5 key entities with relationships
- CRITICAL architecture decision: VISUAL API Toolkit is read-only, MAMP MySQL is system of record for writes

## Next Steps

**Recommended Action**: Proceed to **`/speckit.plan`** to generate technical implementation plan

The specification is complete with all business requirements clarified. Planning phase should focus on:
1. Infor VISUAL API Toolkit integration architecture (read-only API wrappers)
2. MAMP MySQL schema design for local transaction records
3. Performance monitoring implementation in DebugTerminalWindow.axaml
4. Automatic degradation logic (5 consecutive failures → degradation mode)
5. Cache invalidation and refresh strategies
6. Error handling and user notification patterns
