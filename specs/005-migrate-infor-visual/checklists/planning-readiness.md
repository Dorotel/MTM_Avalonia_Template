---

## Planning Phase Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Proceed to `/speckit.plan`** - All critical requirements clarified
2. **Focus areas for planning**:
   - Infor VISUAL API Toolkit integration architecture (read-only wrappers)
   - MAMP MySQL schema for Local Transaction Records
   - DebugTerminalWindow.axaml performance monitoring UI
   - Automatic degradation logic (5-failure threshold)
   - Cache invalidation and refresh strategies

### Low-Priority Questions (Can be resolved during planning)
- **Data Volume Analysis**: How many parts/work orders exist in VISUAL? (Affects cache sizing, pagination defaults)
- **API Endpoint Discovery**: Which specific Infor VISUAL API Toolkit endpoints map to FR-001 through FR-005?
- **Connection Pool Sizing**: Optimal connection pool configuration for expected concurrent user load?

These questions can be answered through:
- Technical research (API Toolkit documentation)
- Data analysis (query production VISUAL database)
- Load testing (prototype performance validation)

### Risks Identified (For Planning Mitigation)
1. **Infor VISUAL API Toolkit documentation may be incomplete** - Mitigation: Budget time for API exploration/testing
2. **Performance targets (<3s) may require optimization** - Mitigation: Include caching strategy in architecture
3. **Hybrid monitoring UI complexity** - Mitigation: Reuse existing DebugTerminalWindow patterns
