  - ✅ **PASS**: FR-020 specifies degradation mode with "manual 'Retry Connection' button and automatic retry every 5 minutes"
  - ✅ FR-008 specifies auto-refresh "within 30 seconds" after connectivity restoration
  - ✅ Behaviors are complementary: Degradation prevents continuous failed calls (5 min cooldown), auto-refresh runs once connectivity is confirmed (30s window)
  - ✅ No conflict: Manual "Retry Connection" allows user to override 5-minute automatic retry

- [x] CHK031 Are work order status transitions (Open → In Progress → Closed) confirmed as irreversible, or must reopening be addressed? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 2 Scenario 3; Data Model §WorkOrder]

    - Inline timestamps in data grids: "HH:mm:ss" format (e.g., "14:35:22")
    - "Last updated" indicators for cached VISUAL data: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" format (e.g., "2025-10-08 14:35:22")
    - Offline mode banner: "Offline Mode - Data as of yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    - File exports: "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss" format for filenames (e.g., "diagnostics-export-20251008-143522.json")

Review changes before saving.' with side-by-side comparison."
  - ✅ Required fields specified: Work order ID, other user name, update timestamp, side-by-side comparison
  - ⚠️ **NOTE**: Since VISUAL integration is read-only (no writes to VISUAL), conflicts would occur in local MySQL only (unlikely with desktop application where each user has own instance)

## Requirement Consistency (Supplemental)

  - ✅ Data Model §LocalTransactionRecord defines audit fields: transaction_id (PK), created_at (timestamp), created_by (username), entity_data (JSON payload), visual_reference_data (cached VISUAL state), audit_metadata (additional info)
  - ✅ User Story scenarios confirm audit trail: "with confirmation and transaction ID" (User Story 3 Scenario 1), "with timestamp" (User Story 2 Scenario 3)
  - ✅ Validation approach: Query LocalTransactionRecords table → verify all required fields populated → confirm JSON structure matches EntityData specifications

## Scenario Coverage (Supplemental)

  - ✅ **PASS**: Edge Cases section documents: "How does system handle large result sets (>10,000 records)? System should implement server-side pagination with VISUAL API, display first 100 results with 'Showing 100 of 10,234 results' indicator, and offer 'Load More' button rather than client-side crash."
  - ✅ Server-side pagination required (not client-side)
  - ✅ Initial page size: 100 results
  - ✅ UI elements: Result count indicator + "Load More" button
  - ✅ Research §Q1 confirms: "Pagination strategy: Load first 100 results, 'Load More' button for additional pages"

- [x] CHK044 Are timeout prompts specifying default selections or fallback actions so operators know how to proceed? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases "VISUAL API Toolkit returns timeout"]
  - ✅ **PASS**: Edge Cases section documents: "What happens when VISUAL API Toolkit returns timeout (>30s)? System should cancel request, log timeout event, and display user-friendly error: 'VISUAL ERP is taking longer than expected. Would you like to retry or work offline?' with 'Retry' and 'Go Offline' buttons."
  - ✅ Timeout threshold: >30 seconds
  - ✅ User options: "Retry" and "Go Offline" buttons (two clear choices)
  - ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: Default selection not specified (e.g., which button is pre-selected or activated on Enter key)
  - ✅ MITIGATION: Standard UI pattern would focus "Retry" button by default (safest choice)

## Non-Functional Requirements (Supplemental)

- [x] CHK045 Are connection pool telemetry expectations (active/idle targets, alert thresholds) articulated for performance monitoring? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-021; Research §Q3]
  - ✅ **PASS**: FR-021 now specifies connection pool monitoring with alert threshold: "Connection pool statistics (active connections, idle connections, total requests, waiting requests, average wait time) with alert displayed when average wait time exceeds 1 second indicating connection pool exhaustion"
  - ✅ Research §Q3 documents monitoring strategy: "Track active connections in DebugTerminalWindow VISUAL Performance panel, Monitor queue depth: Alert if requests wait >1s for available connection"
  - ✅ Implementation verified: ConnectionPoolStats.cs defines MySqlPoolStats with WaitingRequests and AverageWaitTime properties (lines 35-58)
  - ✅ Alert threshold clearly specified: >1 second average wait time triggers connection pool exhaustion alert

- [x] CHK046 Are log redaction requirements stated to prevent credentials or PII from appearing in VISUAL call telemetry? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-019; Plan §Security Guidelines]
  - ✅ **PASS**: FR-011 explicitly states "log all VISUAL API calls... without logging sensitive data (credentials, PII)"
  - ✅ FR-019 specifies structured logging fields (operation type, response time, status) without credential parameters
  - ✅ Security requirement clear: No credentials, no PII in logs

## Dependencies & Assumptions (Supplemental)

- [x] CHK047 Is the assumption about VISUAL service maintenance windows documented, including impact on offline strategy and telemetry baselines? [Assumption, Gap]
  - ⚠️ **GAP**: VISUAL service maintenance windows not documented in spec
  - ✅ **MITIGATION**: SC-004 specifies "excluding scheduled VISUAL maintenance windows" from uptime calculation, acknowledging maintenance exists
  - ✅ Offline strategy (FR-006, FR-007) handles maintenance windows implicitly: Application continues operating with cached data, writes persist to local MySQL
  - 📝 **RECOMMENDATION**: Document expected maintenance window frequency/duration for telemetry baseline establishment

- [x] CHK048 Are Windows Credential Manager entry names and setup steps consistent between requirements and quickstart guidance? [Dependencies, Spec §FR-009; Quickstart §Step 3.1]
  - ✅ **PASS**: FR-009 specifies credential keys: "Visual.Username", "Visual.Password"
  - ✅ Quickstart §Step 3 documents credential setup using WindowsSecretsService pattern (existing Feature 002 implementation)
  - ✅ Consistency: Same key names used in both documents
  - ✅ Implementation: WindowsSecretsService (DPAPI) already tested and operational

## Ambiguities & Conflicts (Supplemental)

- [x] CHK049 Is it explicit whether degradation mode alters export/report capabilities or just live VISUAL queries? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-012; §FR-020]
  - ✅ **PASS**: FR-012 specifies export is for "locally-recorded transactions" stored in MAMP MySQL, not VISUAL data
  - ✅ FR-020 degradation mode affects "live VISUAL API calls" only - stops querying VISUAL, serves from cache
  - ✅ Export functionality (FR-012) operates on local MySQL → unaffected by degradation mode
  - ✅ No ambiguity: Export always available (reads local MySQL, not dependent on VISUAL connectivity)

- [x] CHK050 Do requirements clearly state whether local transactions ever require manual reconciliation with VISUAL, avoiding conflicting expectations? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-017; Research §Data Model]
  - ✅ **PASS**: FR-017 explicitly states "NO synchronization to VISUAL server performed by this application"
  - ✅ FR-016 confirms: "System MUST enforce read-only access to Infor VISUAL ERP via API Toolkit with NO direct write operations"
  - ✅ FR-012 export functionality allows "external processing" (implies manual reconciliation outside application if needed)
  - ✅ No conflicting expectations: Local transactions never auto-sync to VISUAL, manual reconciliation is external process (not application responsibility)
