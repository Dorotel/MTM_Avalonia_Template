## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As an operator, when I launch the manufacturing application, I need the system to initialize all required services in a predictable, safe order before I can begin work, so that I have confidence the application is ready and all dependencies are available. The system should automatically select the best available data source (Visual ERP, MAMP MySQL backup, or local cache) to ensure I can work even when primary systems are unavailable.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the application is not running, **When** the operator launches the app, **Then** a splash screen appears immediately showing initialization progress without requiring any theme or service dependencies.

2. **Given** the splash screen is displayed, **When** all services initialize successfully, **Then** the splash transitions to the main application interface with full theme support and navigation ready.

3. **Given** services are initializing, **When** a critical service fails (e.g., database unreachable), **Then** the splash displays a clear, non-technical error message with Retry and Exit options.

4. **Given** the Visual ERP system is unreachable during startup, **When** the MAMP MySQL server is reachable, **Then** the application loads using MAMP data with a banner indicating "Using backup data source" and shows last MAMP sync timestamp.

5. **Given** both Visual ERP and MAMP MySQL are unreachable during startup, **When** cached data is available, **Then** the application loads in cached-only mode with a banner indicating "Offline - using cached data" and shows cache age.

6. **Given** Visual ERP, MAMP MySQL, and cached data are all unavailable, **When** initialization reaches the data layer stage, **Then** the splash displays an error with Exit-only option (no Retry available).

7. **Given** services are initializing, **When** the operator cancels the startup process, **Then** the application shuts down gracefully without leaving zombie processes or corrupted state.

8. **Given** initialization completes successfully, **When** the application transitions to the main interface, **Then** boot metrics (success/failure status, stage durations, active data source) are persisted for diagnostic review.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when network connectivity is intermittent during reachability checks?
  - No automatic retries; intermittent connectivity is treated as unavailable and triggers immediate cascade to next data source. Operator can manually retry via Retry button, which is disabled for 30 seconds after each click to prevent rapid repeated attempts.
  
- How does the system handle partial cache availability (some master data present, others missing)?
  - Block launch and display error with Exit-only option if any master data type (Items, Locations, WorkCenters) is completely missing. All three types must have at least one record for launch to proceed.
  
- What happens when Visual credentials are valid but Visual API Toolkit endpoint returns unexpected errors?
  - Display specific error context (connection vs. authentication vs. authorization) with actionable guidance.

- When the Visual API Toolkit is partially available (some endpoints work, others fail), how should the system respond?
  - Treat as completely unavailable; cascade to MAMP MySQL fallback.

- What happens when Visual ERP is unreachable but MAMP MySQL connection succeeds yet returns empty result sets?
  - Log warning, treat MAMP as unavailable, cascade to cached data.

- What happens when MAMP MySQL is reachable but returns data that fails validation (schema mismatch, corrupt records)?
  - Log detailed error, treat MAMP as unavailable, cascade to cached data.

- How should the system handle MAMP MySQL connection timeout during reachability check?
  - After timeout expires, treat MAMP as unreachable and cascade to cached data; do not block boot sequence.
  
- How does the system behave when storage space is critically low during cache prefetch?
  - Skip non-critical prefetch, log warning, and continue with minimal viable dataset.

- What happens when cached data exists but is corrupted or fails validation?
  - Delete corrupted cache files, attempt fresh prefetch if Visual ERP is reachable; if Visual is unreachable, block launch with error message and Exit option.

- What happens when an operator launches the application multiple times concurrently (e.g., double-click)?
  - Single-instance enforcement activates existing application window; no duplicate boot sequences run.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a theme-less splash screen immediately upon launch that requires no service dependencies.

- **FR-002**: System MUST initialize services in strict sequential order: configuration ‚Üí secrets ‚Üí logging ‚Üí diagnostics ‚Üí reachability ‚Üí data layers ‚Üí core services ‚Üí caching ‚Üí localization ‚Üí navigation/theming. The localization stage loads the localization framework and infrastructure only; actual UI content translation occurs post-boot in the main application.

- **FR-003**: System MUST show real-time progress indicators during each initialization stage on the splash screen, displaying all 10 stages individually with stage names (configuration, secrets, logging, diagnostics, reachability, data layers, core services, caching, localization, navigation/theming).

- **FR-004**: System MUST validate environment configuration (Development/Staging/Production) and feature flags before proceeding with service initialization.

- **FR-005**: System MUST load user credentials securely without logging or persisting them in source control.

- **FR-006**: System MUST establish logging and telemetry sinks (console, file) before any other service-dependent operations.

- **FR-007**: System MUST verify system diagnostics including file permissions, available storage, and required hardware (camera on Android).

- **FR-008**: System MUST perform reachability checks for required endpoints in priority order: Visual API Toolkit first, then MAMP MySQL 5.7 server, with independent timeout handling for each endpoint (10 seconds per endpoint).

- **FR-009**: System MUST initialize data layer connections with cascading fallback: Visual API Toolkit (primary), MAMP MySQL 5.7 (secondary backup for master data), and local cache (tertiary). Desktop platforms connect to MAMP via MySQL client; Android platforms connect via API client that proxies MAMP queries.

- **FR-010**: System MUST access Visual ERP data exclusively through read-only API Toolkit commands, never via direct SQL.

- **FR-011**: System MUST attempt to prefetch master data (Items, Locations, WorkCenters) using cascading source priority: Visual API Toolkit first (respecting maintenance windows read via API), then MAMP MySQL 5.7 if Visual unavailable, then local cache as final fallback. All prefetch operations are best-effort with configurable time limits; failures trigger automatic cascade to next source. System MUST verify that cache contains at least one record from each master data type (Items, Locations, WorkCenters); if any type is completely missing, block launch with Exit-only option.

- **FR-012**: System MUST display a persistent, non-dismissible status banner in the status bar (bottom of interface) indicating the active data source: "Live data (Visual ERP)" when using Visual API Toolkit, "Backup data (last synced: [timestamp])" when using MAMP MySQL, or "Offline - Cached data (age: [duration])" when using local cache. Banner color coding: green for Visual, yellow for MAMP, orange for cached data.

- **FR-013**: System MUST provide Retry and Exit options when initialization failures occur; operator manually triggers retry via Retry button (no automatic retry attempts or automatic source cascade during retry). Retry always attempts Visual ‚Üí MAMP ‚Üí Cache cascade from the beginning. Retry button MUST be disabled for 30 seconds after each click to prevent rapid repeated attempts. If all three sources fail after operator retries, display Exit-only option with detailed error showing which sources were attempted.

- **FR-014**: System MUST display simple, non-technical error messages to operators while capturing detailed diagnostic information in logs.

- **FR-015**: System MUST allow operator-initiated cancellation of the startup process at any stage.

- **FR-016**: System MUST fail fast only on invalid Visual credentials; unreachable Visual endpoints trigger automatic cascade to MAMP MySQL, then to cached data if MAMP also unavailable. Only when all three sources fail does the system block launch with Exit-only option.

- **FR-017**: System MUST transition from splash to themed main interface only after all mandatory initialization completes.

- **FR-018**: - **FR-018**: System MUST persist boot metrics including success/failure status, stage durations, and error details to local file system (JSON or CSV format) for diagnostic purposes, retaining the last 100 boot attempts with automatic FIFO rotation (oldest entry deleted when 101st boot occurs).

- **FR-019**: System MUST complete initialization in a deterministic, idempotent manner that can be safely retried.

- **FR-020**: System MUST enforce that Android devices never connect directly to Visual database, only through API projections.

- **FR-021**: System MUST enforce single-instance operation; subsequent launch attempts bring existing application window to foreground rather than starting new instances.

- **FR-022**: System MUST query MAMP MySQL for last sync timestamp from Visual ERP and display this information in the status banner when operating in MAMP fallback mode, warning operators when MAMP data is older than 24 hours.

### Performance Requirements

- **PR-001**: Splash screen MUST appear within 500ms of application launch.

- **PR-002**: Normal startup sequence (all services healthy) MUST complete within 10 seconds on hardware meeting minimum OS requirements for Windows/Android.

- **PR-003**: Each individual reachability check (Visual API Toolkit, MAMP MySQL) MUST timeout after 10 seconds; total cascading reachability check time MUST NOT exceed 25 seconds to prevent indefinite blocking.

- **PR-004**: Cache prefetch operations MUST respect configurable time limits (default 30 seconds, range 10-120 seconds) to avoid blocking startup indefinitely.

- **PR-005**: Memory overhead during initialization MUST remain under 200MB to support resource-constrained mobile devices.

### Security Requirements

- **SR-001**: System MUST load Visual user credentials from secure local storage, never from source code or configuration files.

- **SR-002**: System MUST validate credentials against Visual ERP system via API call before attempting further Visual API Toolkit operations.

- **SR-003**: System MUST never log credential values in any telemetry or diagnostic output.

- **SR-004**: System MUST establish secure connections (TLS/HTTPS) for all network reachability checks and data operations.

- **SR-005**: System MUST load MAMP MySQL credentials from secure local storage separately from Visual credentials, never logging or persisting them in source control. MAMP credentials are read-only access credentials with no write or administrative privileges.

### Key Entities

- **Boot Stage**: Represents a discrete initialization phase (Stage 0 Pre-init, Stage 1 Initialization substeps, Stage 2 Transition) with status, progress percentage, duration, and error details.

- **Service Configuration**: Environment settings, feature flags, endpoint URLs, timeout values, and platform-specific parameters.

- **Reachability Status**: Network connectivity state for all three data sources (Visual API Toolkit, MAMP MySQL, local cache), endpoint availability per source, response times, last successful check timestamp per source, and active data source indicator.

- **Boot Metrics**: Startup telemetry including stage-by-stage durations, failure points, retry counts, overall success/failure status, and active data source selected (Visual/MAMP/Cache) with fallback cascade history.

- **Cache Manifest**: Inventory of prefetched master data including entity types, record counts, last sync timestamp, data source origin (Visual/MAMP/Cache), sync success/failure status per source, and staleness indicators (cached data older than 24 hours is considered stale; MAMP data staleness depends on last Visual-to-MAMP sync).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: Which master data entities are considered critical (app blocks if unavailable) versus non-critical (app warns but continues)? ‚Üí A: None critical; always allow operation using best available source (Visual ‚Üí MAMP ‚Üí Cache cascade) with appropriate warnings
- Q: When retry attempts are exhausted, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Each retry attempts full Visual ‚Üí MAMP ‚Üí Cache cascade; if all three sources fail, display Exit-only option
- Q: Which initialization stages should be displayed on the splash screen? ‚Üí A: All 10 stages shown individually with stage names
- Q: Where should boot metrics be stored and for how long? ‚Üí A: Local file system (JSON/CSV); retain last 100 boots
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent application launch attempts? ‚Üí A: Single instance only; subsequent launches activate existing window
- Q: SR-002 mentions validating credentials against an "authorized user database" before attempting Visual API connections. What is this authorized user database? ‚Üí A: The Visual ERP system itself (validation happens via API call)
- Q: FR-012 mentions displaying a "persistent warning banner" when in cached-only mode. Where should this banner appear and can operators dismiss it? ‚Üí A: Status bar at bottom, always visible, cannot be dismissed
- Q: FR-011 mentions respecting "maintenance windows" during cache prefetch. What defines a maintenance window in this context? ‚Üí A: Scheduled time periods configured in Visual ERP system that the app reads via API
- Q: PR-002 requires completion within 10 seconds on "typical hardware". What constitutes typical hardware for acceptance testing? ‚Üí A: Any hardware meeting minimum OS requirements for Windows/Android
- Q: PR-004 mentions "configurable time limits" for cache prefetch operations. What are the default/expected timeout values? ‚Üí A: 30 seconds default, configurable 10-120 seconds range
- Q: FR-013 mentions retry attempts but doesn't specify the retry strategy. How many retry attempts should the system allow before exhausting retries, and what delays should be used between attempts? ‚Üí A: No automatic retries; operator must manually click Retry button
- Q: What should happen if cached data exists but is corrupted or fails validation (e.g., malformed JSON, schema mismatch)? ‚Üí A: Delete corrupted cache, attempt fresh prefetch if Visual available, otherwise block launch
- Q: FR-018 specifies boot metrics should retain the last 100 boot attempts. When the 101st boot occurs, how should old metrics be deleted? ‚Üí A: Delete oldest single entry (FIFO rotation)
- Q: The Cache Manifest entity mentions "staleness indicators" but doesn't specify thresholds. How old should cached data be before it's considered stale and triggers warnings? ‚Üí A: 24 hours (1 day) - manufacturing data changes daily
- Q: When the Visual API Toolkit is partially available (e.g., authentication endpoint works but data retrieval endpoints fail), how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Treat Visual as completely unavailable; cascade to MAMP MySQL fallback, then to cached data if needed
- Q: Which content types must support localization during the boot sequence? ‚Üí A: None - localization stage loads framework only; actual content translation happens post-boot
- Q: What is the MAMP MySQL 5.7 server and how does it fit into the data architecture? ‚Üí A: Intermediate backup data source between Visual ERP (primary) and local cache (tertiary); contains master data synced from Visual but may be less current than Visual
- Q: When should the system use MAMP MySQL versus local cache? ‚Üí A: Always attempt Visual first, cascade to MAMP if Visual unreachable, cascade to cache only if both Visual and MAMP unavailable
- Q: Should MAMP credentials be the same as Visual credentials or separate? ‚Üí A: Separate read-only credentials stored in secure local storage; MAMP access does not require Visual authentication
- Q: How should the system display data source status to operators in the UI? ‚Üí A: Persistent status banner at bottom with color coding: green (Visual), yellow (MAMP with sync timestamp), orange (cached data with age)
- Q: When cascading from Visual to MAMP to Cache, should the system attempt all three sources in parallel or sequentially? ‚Üí A: Sequential cascade with fail-fast: only attempt next source if current source is confirmed unavailable
- Q: When network connectivity is intermittent during a single reachability check, should the system perform automatic retries with backoff, or does "no automatic retries" mean each reachability check gets exactly one attempt? ‚Üí A: No automatic retries at any level; intermittent connectivity treated as unavailable and cascades immediately. Retry button disabled for 30 seconds after click to prevent rapid repeated attempts.
- Q: When cache is the only available data source but only contains partial master data (e.g., Items present but Locations missing), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Block launch if any master data type is completely missing; require at least one record from each type (Items, Locations, WorkCenters).
