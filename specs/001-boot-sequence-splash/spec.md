## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As an operator, when I launch the application, I need a clear, informative startup experience that:

- Shows me the application is starting and making progress
- Informs me if any problems occur during startup
- Gives me options to retry or exit if startup fails
- Ensures all required systems are ready before I can use the application
- Works predictably every time, even when network or servers are unavailable

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the application is closed, **When** I launch the application, **Then** I see a splash screen showing initialization progress with clear status messages and progress indicators

2. **Given** the application is starting, **When** all services initialize successfully, **Then** the splash screen disappears and I'm taken to the home screen within expected time limits

3. **Given** the application is initializing, **When** Visual ERP server is unreachable, **Then** I see a clear error message and options to Retry or continue in cached-only mode

4. **Given** startup fails due to invalid credentials, **When** I see the error message, **Then** I can choose to Exit and correct the credentials or Retry

5. **Given** the application is caching master data, **When** the cache operation takes longer than expected, **Then** I see progress updates with percentage complete and estimated time remaining

6. **Given** I'm working in cached-only mode (Visual offline), **When** I use the application, **Then** I see a persistent banner warning me that data may be stale

7. **Given** the application crashed on previous launch, **When** I launch it again, **Then** the system detects the previous crash and offers options to continue normally or skip problematic features

8. **Given** system diagnostics detect issues, **When** startup encounters permission or storage problems, **Then** I see specific guidance on how to resolve the issue

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the application takes longer than timeout limits to start? System displays timeout error with Retry/Exit options and logs diagnostic information
- What happens when both Visual and MySQL are unreachable? Application shows clear error indicating which services are down and prevents startup (cannot operate without minimum viable services)
- What happens when cache is corrupted or incomplete? System detects corruption, attempts automatic recovery, and re-fetches data if recovery fails
- What happens when the operator cancels startup mid-process? All in-progress operations are cancelled cleanly, resources are released, and application exits gracefully
- What happens when configuration files are missing or malformed? System shows validation errors with specific details about what's wrong and prevents startup
- What happens when startup succeeds but a background service fails later? The affected features gracefully degrade, user is notified, and application continues operating with reduced functionality
- What happens when device storage is critically low? Diagnostics detect low storage during startup, warn user, and may skip cache operations to conserve space

## Notes for Planning Phase

This specification comprehensively covers the boot sequence orchestration system. Key considerations for the planning phase:

1. **Strict Ordering**: Stage 1 initialization must follow exact sequence defined in source document
2. **Performance Targets**: Boot time budget of <3 seconds for Stage 1 must be considered in implementation planning
3. **Failure Scenarios**: Every failure point needs retry logic, user communication, and diagnostic capture
4. **Visual Constraints**: Read-only access via API Toolkit is non-negotiable; direct SQL access is prohibited
5. **Cached-Only Mode**: Critical fallback mode that must maintain user productivity during Visual outages
6. **Accessibility**: Splash screen must support screen readers and system dark mode from day one
7. **Testing Strategy**: Boot sequence requires extensive integration testing with various failure scenarios
8. **Monitoring**: Boot metrics and service health checks are essential for production support
9. **Admin Dashboard (FR-132)**: Deferred to post-MVP release. Initial release uses log file review for service monitoring.
10. **API Documentation (FR-134)**: Deferred as development tooling requirement. Will be addressed through XML documentation comments and optional DocFX generation in polish phase.

The feature is expansive with 160 functional requirements covering 13 distinct subsystems. Planning should consider breaking this into prioritized implementation phases while maintaining the core boot orchestration as the foundation.
