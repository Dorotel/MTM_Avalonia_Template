## Issue C1: Missing Tasks for FR-132 (Admin Monitoring Dashboard)

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Coverage Gap  
**Location**: spec.md FR-132, tasks.md

### Problem
FR-132 requires "System MUST provide admin monitoring dashboard for service status" but no corresponding implementation tasks exist in tasks.md.

### Decision Required
Is FR-132 part of MVP scope or post-MVP feature?

### Option A: Include in MVP (Add Tasks)

Add after T132 (Platform Entry Points):

```markdown
### Platform Admin Tools

- [ ] T133A AdminDashboardViewModel in MTM_Template_Application/ViewModels/AdminDashboardViewModel.cs - [ObservableObject], [ObservableProperty] for service status, [RelayCommand] for refresh/restart services
- [ ] T133B AdminDashboardView.axaml in MTM_Template_Application/Views/AdminDashboardView.axaml - Display service health, boot metrics, connection pool status, cache statistics (Theme V2 tokens)
- [ ] T133C AdminDashboardView.axaml.cs code-behind in MTM_Template_Application/Views/AdminDashboardView.axaml.cs - Wire up ViewModel
- [ ] T133D RoleBasedAccessGuard in MTM_Template_Application/Services/Navigation/RoleBasedAccessGuard.cs - Restrict admin dashboard to authorized roles (per constitution RBAC requirement)
```

Update Phase 3.8 section title to "Platform Entry Points & Admin Tools"

Renumber existing T133-T170 to T134-T171 (shift all subsequent tasks by 4).

### Option B: Defer to Post-MVP (Update Spec)

Update spec.md FR-132:

```markdown
- **FR-132**: [POST-MVP] System MUST provide admin monitoring dashboard for service status
```

Add note to spec.md "Notes for Planning Phase" section:

```markdown
8. **Admin Dashboard (FR-132)**: Deferred to post-MVP release. Initial release uses log file review for service monitoring.
```

### Recommendation
**Option B (Defer to Post-MVP)** - Admin dashboard is valuable but not blocking for initial release. Service health is already exposed via:
- Boot metrics (FR-127, FR-135)
- Health check service (FR-077)
- Diagnostic bundles (FR-140)
- Telemetry exports (FR-135)

Operators can monitor services through logs and telemetry. Dashboard provides nicer UX but doesn't add core capability.

## Issue C2: Missing Tasks for FR-134 (API Documentation Generation)

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Coverage Gap  
**Location**: spec.md FR-134, tasks.md

### Problem
FR-134 requires "System MUST generate API documentation from service interfaces" but no corresponding implementation tasks exist.

### Decision Required
Is FR-134 a runtime feature or development tooling requirement?

### Option A: Runtime Feature (Swagger/OpenAPI for HTTP API)

Add after T132 (Platform Entry Points):

```markdown
### API Documentation

- [ ] T133E Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package reference to MTM_Template_Application.csproj (if HTTP API exposed)
- [ ] T133F OpenAPI configuration in MTM_Template_Application/Services/Documentation/OpenApiConfiguration.cs - Configure Swagger generation for HTTP API endpoints
- [ ] T133G API documentation endpoint /api/docs - Expose Swagger UI for API exploration (admin role only)
```

### Option B: Development Tooling (XML Documentation Comments)

Add to Phase 3.11 (Polish and Validation):

```markdown
- [ ] T171 XML documentation comments for all public service interfaces - Add /// <summary>, <param>, <returns> for IntelliSense
- [ ] T172 Enable XML documentation generation in MTM_Template_Application.csproj - Set <GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>
- [ ] T173 DocFX or similar tool setup - Generate static API documentation site from XML comments
```

### Option C: Defer as Non-Functional (Update Spec)

Update spec.md FR-134:

```markdown
- **FR-134**: [DEFERRED] System SHOULD generate API documentation from service interfaces for developer reference
```

Change "MUST" to "SHOULD" to indicate nice-to-have rather than requirement.

### Recommendation
**Option B (Development Tooling)** - API documentation is valuable for maintainers but not end-users. XML documentation comments + generation tool (DocFX, Sandcastle) provides:
- IntelliSense in IDE
- Generated reference documentation
- Minimal runtime overhead (comments don't affect compiled code)

This aligns with "Development Workflow" constitutional principle (documentation for production-ready template).

## Issue I1: Entity Count Mismatch

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Inconsistency  
**Location**: plan.md L124, tasks.md T016-T038

### Problem
plan.md claims "40+ entities defined" but data-model.md contains exactly 23 entities (verified by reading data-model.md). tasks.md correctly creates 23 entity model tasks (T016-T038).

### Concrete Edit

**File**: `specs/001-boot-sequence-splash/plan.md`

**Line ~124** (in "Phase 1: Design & Contracts" section):

**FIND**:
```markdown
### 1. Data Model

[data-model.md](./data-model.md) defines 40+ entities organized by subsystem:
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
### 1. Data Model

[data-model.md](./data-model.md) defines 23 entities organized by subsystem:
```

**Also update line ~298** (in "Estimated Task Count" section):

**FIND**:
```markdown
- Entity models: ~40 tasks (from data-model.md)
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
- Entity models: ~23 tasks (from data-model.md)
```

**Also update line ~302** (in "Total" calculation):

**FIND**:
```markdown
- **Total: ~155 tasks**
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
- **Total: ~138 tasks** (updated after entity count correction)
```

**Note**: Actual tasks.md has 170 tasks (more than estimated), which is acceptable - estimates were conservative.

### Rationale
Corrects factual error. The "40+" claim was likely an early estimate before detailed entity modeling. Actual entity count is 23 as defined in data-model.md and implemented in tasks T016-T038.

## Issue A1: Clarification Answer Not Reflected in Spec (Visual API Whitelist)

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Clarification Gap  
**Location**: spec.md FR-151, clarify/outstanding-questions-visual-integration-2025-10-02.md Q1

### Problem
Clarification file specifies explicit whitelist of Visual API Toolkit commands (Answer A: "Yes, explicit whitelist") but spec.md FR-151 only says "API Toolkit commands only" without referencing the whitelist.

### Concrete Edit

**File**: `specs/001-boot-sequence-splash/spec.md`

**Line ~152** (FR-151 in "Visual Server Integration Constraints" section):

**FIND**:
```markdown
- **FR-151**: System MUST access Visual via API Toolkit commands only (never direct SQL)
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
- **FR-151**: System MUST access Visual via API Toolkit commands only (never direct SQL), using explicit command whitelist defined in docs/VISUAL-WHITELIST.md
```

### Rationale
Incorporates clarification decision (Q1: explicit whitelist for security) into functional requirement. Makes security constraint visible to business stakeholders. References existing whitelist documentation.

---

## Issue A2: Clarification Answer Not Reflected in Spec (Android Authentication)

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Clarification Gap  
**Location**: spec.md FR-154, clarify/outstanding-questions-visual-integration-2025-10-02.md Q3

### Problem
Clarification file specifies two-factor authentication for Android (Answer E: "Combination: User credentials + device certificate") but spec.md FR-154 only says "via API projections" without authentication details.

### Concrete Edit

**File**: `specs/001-boot-sequence-splash/spec.md`

**Line ~154** (FR-154 in "Visual Server Integration Constraints" section):

**FIND**:
```markdown
- **FR-154**: Android devices MUST access Visual data via API projections only
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
- **FR-154**: Android devices MUST access Visual data via API projections only, authenticating with two-factor auth (user credentials + device certificate stored in Android KeyStore)
```

### Rationale
Incorporates clarification decision (Q3: two-factor authentication) into functional requirement. Makes security model visible to stakeholders. Specifies Android KeyStore as secure storage mechanism.

## Issue U1: Underspecified Performance Benchmarks

**Severity**: LOW  
**Category**: Underspecification  
**Location**: spec.md FR-047

### Problem
FR-047 says "System MUST run performance benchmarks on startup to detect slow hardware" but doesn't specify which benchmarks or what thresholds constitute "slow".

### Concrete Edit

**File**: `specs/001-boot-sequence-splash/spec.md`

**Line ~47** (FR-047 in "Diagnostics & System Health" section):

**FIND**:
```markdown
- **FR-047**: System MUST run performance benchmarks on startup to detect slow hardware
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
- **FR-047**: System MUST run performance benchmarks on startup to detect slow hardware (CPU benchmark <100ms baseline, disk I/O >50MB/s sequential read, memory allocation <10ms for 10MB block)
```

### Rationale
Adds measurable acceptance criteria. Thresholds are realistic baselines for modern hardware (even low-end tablets meet these). Enables objective validation during testing.

---

## Issue U2: Underspecified Network Quality Thresholds

**Severity**: LOW  
**Category**: Underspecification  
**Location**: spec.md FR-048

### Problem
FR-048 says "System MUST measure network quality (latency/bandwidth) to remote endpoints" but doesn't define what constitutes "good" vs "poor" quality.

### Concrete Edit

**File**: `specs/001-boot-sequence-splash/spec.md`

**Line ~48** (FR-048 in "Diagnostics & System Health" section):

**FIND**:
```markdown
- **FR-048**: System MUST measure network quality (latency/bandwidth) to remote endpoints
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
- **FR-048**: System MUST measure network quality (latency/bandwidth) to remote endpoints (Good: latency <100ms and bandwidth >1Mbps; Poor: latency >500ms or bandwidth <256Kbps; Warning: values between Good and Poor)
```

### Rationale
Adds measurable thresholds aligned with manufacturing network expectations. Values based on:
- Good: Modern LAN/WiFi performance
- Warning: Acceptable but degraded performance
- Poor: Triggers cached-only mode consideration

Enables objective health reporting to operators.

## Issue U3: Underspecified Memory Budget

**Severity**: LOW  
**Category**: Underspecification  
**Location**: spec.md FR-131

### Problem
FR-131 says "System MUST enforce memory budget for startup operations" but doesn't specify the MB value. plan.md specifies 100MB but this isn't in the requirement.

### Concrete Edit

**File**: `specs/001-boot-sequence-splash/spec.md`

**Line ~131** (FR-131 in "Boot Orchestration & Stage Management" section):

**FIND**:
```markdown
- **FR-131**: System MUST enforce memory budget for startup operations
```

**REPLACE WITH**:
```markdown
- **FR-131**: System MUST enforce memory budget for startup operations (target: <100MB peak memory usage during boot, including all services and initial cache population)
```

### Rationale
Incorporates specific budget from plan.md (Performance Goals: Memory <100MB). Makes requirement testable. Aligns with manufacturing device constraints (tablets with limited RAM).

## Validation After Remediation

After applying changes, run validation:

```powershell
# Re-run analysis to verify issues resolved
# (This command from analyze.prompt.md)
cd C:\Users\johnk\source\repos\MTM_Avalonia_Template
.\.specify\scripts\powershell\check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks

# Expected result after remediation:
# - 0 critical issues (unchanged)
# - 0-2 medium issues (depending on C1/C2 decisions)
# - 0 low issues (all resolved)
```

Verify:
- [ ] Entity count consistent across plan.md and tasks.md
- [ ] All clarification answers reflected in spec.md
- [ ] All requirements have measurable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Coverage gaps addressed (FR-132, FR-134)
- [ ] No new inconsistencies introduced

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Implementation)
1. ✅ **Apply Phase 2 corrections** (I1, U1, U2, U3) - These are factual corrections and enhancements with no risk
2. ✅ **Apply Phase 3 enhancements** (A1, A2) - These align spec with clarification decisions already made in plan.md
3. ⚠️ **Decide C1 and C2** - Both are legitimately optional for MVP; recommend deferring both to post-MVP

### Recommended Decisions
- **C1 (Admin Dashboard)**: **Defer to post-MVP** - Service monitoring covered by logs/telemetry/diagnostics
- **C2 (API Documentation)**: **Include as dev tooling** - XML comments + DocFX in Phase 3.11 polish tasks

### Post-Remediation
- Re-run `/analyze` command to verify 0 issues remain
- Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with corrected entity count (currently accurate, no change needed)
- Proceed to implementation with confidence - all artifacts aligned
