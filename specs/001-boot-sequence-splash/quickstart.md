   - [ ] Credential entry exists: `MTM.Template.Visual.Password`
   - [ ] Encrypted at rest (DPAPI)

3. **Verify No Logging**
   ```powershell
   # Search all logs for password
   Get-ChildItem ".\logs\*.log" | Select-String -Pattern "test_password"
   ```
   - [ ] No results found (password never logged)
