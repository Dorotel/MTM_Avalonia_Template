## Questions (10 total)

### Q1: [Data Model] - Configuration override precedence order

**Impact**: High
**Category**: Domain & Data Model
**Feature Context**: FR-012 configuration layering with override precedence

What is the exact precedence order for configuration layering (highest to lowest)?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Command-line args > Environment vars > User config file > App config file > Defaults |
| B | Remote config > Command-line args > Environment vars > Local config > Defaults |
| C | Environment vars > Command-line args > Remote config > Local config > Defaults |
| D | User config > Machine config > Environment vars > App config > Defaults |

**Answer: A — Command-line args > Environment vars > User config file > App config file > Defaults**

Reasoning: Standard precedence pattern prioritizes explicit runtime overrides (CLI args), then environment-specific settings (env vars), then user preferences, then application defaults. This allows debugging/testing overrides while respecting user preferences in normal operation.

### Q2: [Functional Scope] - Feature flag evaluation timing

**Impact**: High
**Category**: Functional Scope & Behavior
**Feature Context**: FR-013 feature flags that control behavior

When are feature flags evaluated?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Once at startup only |
| B | At startup + on-demand when feature is accessed |
| C | Continuously (real-time updates from server) |
| D | Startup + periodic refresh (configurable interval) |

**Answer: B — At startup + on-demand when feature is accessed**

Reasoning: Balances performance with flexibility. Startup evaluation provides initial state; lazy evaluation on access allows hot-reload scenarios without continuous polling overhead. Real-time updates (C) add complexity; periodic refresh (D) can miss critical changes.

### Q3: [Non-Functional] - Hot reload scope limitation

**Impact**: High
**Category**: Non-Functional Quality Attributes
**Feature Context**: FR-014 hot reload without restart

Which configuration changes can be hot-reloaded vs. require restart?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | All settings can be hot-reloaded |
| B | Only UI theme, logging levels, and feature flags |
| C | Everything except connection strings and security settings |
| D | Only settings explicitly marked as "hot-reloadable" in config schema |

**Answer: D — Only settings explicitly marked as "hot-reloadable" in config schema**

Reasoning: Explicit opt-in prevents bugs from reloading settings that require coordinated state changes. Schema-driven approach makes hot-reload capability discoverable and maintainable. Default to safe (require restart) unless proven hot-reloadable.

### Q4: [Data Model] - Configuration validation timing

**Impact**: High
**Category**: Domain & Data Model
**Feature Context**: FR-015 validate configuration on load

When should configuration validation occur?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Only at initial load (startup) |
| B | At load + before every hot reload |
| C | At load + continuous validation in background |
| D | At load + on-demand via admin command |

**Answer: B — At load + before every hot reload**

Reasoning: Validation must occur before applying changes to prevent invalid configurations from breaking running systems. Continuous validation (C) adds overhead; on-demand only (D) allows invalid configs to persist undetected.

### Q5: [Functional Scope] - Configuration profile structure

**Impact**: Medium
**Category**: Domain & Data Model
**Feature Context**: FR-016 multiple configuration profiles

How are configuration profiles structured?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Separate files (config.dev.json, config.staging.json, config.prod.json) |
| B | Single file with sections ([Development], [Staging], [Production]) |
| C | Base file + overlay files (config.base.json + config.dev.json) |
| D | Database-driven with profile selector |

**Answer: C — Base file + overlay files (config.base.json + config.dev.json)**

Reasoning: Overlay pattern (DRY principle) avoids duplication, clearly shows environment-specific overrides, and integrates well with version control. Separate files (A) duplicate common settings; single file (B) becomes unwieldy; database (D) adds external dependency.

### Q6: [Integration] - Environment auto-detection priority

**Impact**: Medium
**Category**: Integration & External Dependencies
**Feature Context**: FR-017 auto-detect environment from hostname/IP/path

What is the fallback order for environment auto-detection?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Hostname → IP range → Deployment path → Manual selection |
| B | Environment variable → Hostname → IP range → Config file |
| C | Deployment path → IP range → Hostname → User prompt |
| D | Config file → Environment variable → Hostname → Default (Development) |

**Answer: B — Environment variable → Hostname → IP range → Config file**

Reasoning: Env vars provide explicit runtime control (CI/CD, containers); hostname is reliable infrastructure signal; IP ranges handle network-based detection; config file provides fallback. Ends with safe Development default rather than user prompt.

### Q7: [Non-Functional] - Configuration audit log format

**Impact**: Low
**Category**: Non-Functional Quality Attributes
**Feature Context**: FR-018 audit all configuration changes

What information should configuration audit logs include?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Timestamp + Setting name + New value + Source |
| B | Timestamp + Setting name + Old value + New value + User + Source |
| C | Full snapshot before/after + Timestamp + User + Source + Reason |
| D | Setting name + New value + Timestamp (minimal) |

**Answer: B — Timestamp + Setting name + Old value + New value + User + Source**

Reasoning: Provides full change context (what changed, from/to, who, when, where) for troubleshooting and compliance without full snapshot overhead (C). Essential for config debugging and audit trails.

### Q8: [Security] - Encrypted configuration section scope

**Impact**: High
**Category**: Non-Functional Quality Attributes
**Feature Context**: FR-019 encrypted configuration sections

Which configuration sections require encryption?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | All credentials (passwords, tokens, API keys) |
| B | Credentials + connection strings |
| C | Credentials + connection strings + PII |
| D | Any section marked "sensitive" in schema + all credentials |

**Answer: D — Any section marked "sensitive" in schema + all credentials**

Reasoning: Schema-driven approach ensures all credentials are encrypted by default while allowing flexible marking of additional sensitive sections (PII, business-critical data). Supports evolving security requirements without code changes.

### Q9: [Integration] - Remote configuration update mechanism

**Impact**: Medium
**Category**: Integration & External Dependencies
**Feature Context**: FR-020 remote configuration pull

How should remote configuration updates be delivered?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Pull: Application polls central server at startup + intervals |
| B | Push: Central server sends updates via message queue |
| C | Hybrid: Polling + webhook for immediate updates |
| D | Manual: Admin downloads and applies updates |

**Answer: A — Pull: Application polls central server at startup + intervals**

Reasoning: Simpler infrastructure (no message queue), firewall-friendly (outbound only), client controls timing. For multi-site manufacturing, predictable polling is more reliable than push infrastructure. Intervals configurable per environment needs.

### Q10: [Functional Scope] - Configuration conflict resolution

**Impact**: High
**Category**: Edge Cases & Failure Handling
**Feature Context**: Configuration layering and hot reload

When remote config conflicts with local user config, which wins?

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Remote config always wins (enforce central policy) |
| B | Local user config always wins (user autonomy) |
| C | Most recently changed wins (timestamp-based) |
| D | Configurable per-setting (some centrally managed, some user-controlled) |

**Answer: D — Configurable per-setting (some centrally managed, some user-controlled)**

Reasoning: Manufacturing environments need both central policy enforcement (security, compliance) and user autonomy (UI preferences, workflow customization). Setting-level control balances these needs. Mark settings as "centrally-managed" or "user-configurable" in schema.
