The user input can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

   **HALT CHECK**: If `{FEATURE_DIR}/clarification-needed.md` exists (without `-complete.md` suffix), STOP immediately. Inform user: "Cannot proceed with /implement - clarification needed. Run /clarify to resolve blocking questions, then re-run /implement." Do not begin implementation.

2. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read clarify/ folder for clarification decisions:
     - Load all `{FEATURE_DIR}/clarify/outstanding-questions-*.md` files
     - Extract answered questions and reasoning (look for `**Answer:` or `Answer:` patterns)
     - Use clarification answers to guide implementation choices:
       - Configuration precedence rules
       - Retry policies and backoff strategies
       - Authentication mechanisms
       - Performance thresholds
       - Error handling patterns
       - User experience behaviors
     - When making design decisions during implementation, reference specific clarifications
     - If implementation conflicts with a clarification answer, flag it for review

3. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

4. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

5. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

6. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

   **CLARIFICATION HALT DURING IMPLEMENTATION**: If, while executing tasks, you encounter a blocking ambiguity that prevents correct implementation (e.g., unclear business rule, conflicting requirements, missing specification details that affect core logic), STOP immediately:
   - Create `{FEATURE_DIR}/clarification-needed.md` with structure:
     ```markdown
     # Clarification Needed - Implementation Blocked
     **Generated by**: /implement command
     **Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
     **Status**: Awaiting clarification

     ## Context
     Implementation halted at task [Task ID] due to blocking ambiguity in specification or design.

     ## Progress Before Halt
     - Completed tasks: [list of completed task IDs]
     - Current task: [Task ID and description]
     - Blocked at: [specific file, method, or logic point]

     ## Blocking Questions
     [List specific questions about business logic, data flow, error handling, or integration that must be answered]

     ## Technical Impact
     Proceeding without clarification would result in:
     - [specific technical risk, e.g., "Incorrect data validation logic"]
     - [specific user impact, e.g., "Users unable to recover from error state"]
     ```
   - Mark the current task with status "⚠️ BLOCKED - See clarification-needed.md"
   - Inform user: "Implementation halted due to blocking ambiguity. Created {FEATURE_DIR}/clarification-needed.md. Run /clarify to resolve, then re-run /implement to continue from task [Task ID]."
   - Exit implementation workflow

7. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.
